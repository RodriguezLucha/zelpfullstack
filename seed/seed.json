            "You usually don't give this high of a rating to tourist traps which is what I intially thought through bad experiences in hyped up places in super touristy spots. As a Bay Area local, this my friends is not one of those places! Service was great, (props to our server Justin!)  On a super busy Sunday Dinner Rush, our service was prompt, helpful, Justin tended to our needs quickly and even put on our seafood bibs! Finally, we were there for a bday and Justin kindly hooked us up with a dessert! The food: food quality usually lacks in these types of restaurants but not here! Seafood and meat entrees were great! We had the Seafood tower which is on the pricier sad but everything on it was super fresh and incredible and best for all seafood lovers. Though surprisingly the STAR of the show is the Mussel Fries! Whatever the sauce comes with these is an incredible mix of flavors. I've had many Mussels dishes, this seriously tops them all. All of our entrees (two pasta dishes, a seafood mixed grill, and a flat iron steak) were all great as well. All was finished except that my seafood grill had Sole on it which is bland for me but not their fault. Everything else on my plate was delicious.Whether you're a local or a visitor, put this spot on your list! Beat the crowd and go on a weekday or make rezzies.",
            "Ordered: half dozen oysters, crab cake and cioppino.Oysters were so fresh and sweet. I'm usually used to the happy hour blue pt oysters but these were smaller but sweeter.Crab cakes were great as well.First time trying cioppino. I really enjoyed it. We got it lazy style and crab meat was already picked out for us.Service was great. Atmosphere would be great for date night. We were sat by a window and overlooking the boats and water.",
            "It was a good dining experience we had the following:Chowder with Crab - Some of the best chowder I've had the crab was a delicious addition. Crab Ceviche - Very fresh and tasty! Whole Steamed Crab - Freshness was excellent but was a bit bland.  Mixed Grill - Seasoned well very good.",
            "Seafood tasted ok, seating is comfortable but the food portion was small to its price and service was a bit lacking.",
            "Located at Pier 39, I'll be honest and say this spot is a HUUUUGE tourist restaurant, but living in the Bay Area I have to admit that Fog harbor is a great spot to grab lunch with a view. Known for their whole Dungeness crabs (steamed, cracked, garlic, chili, etc.) definitely come now since they're in season. Knowing how busy this place can get I recommend making a reservation before hand. We made a reservation the day of for 2 people at 12:30PM with no issue. If you forget to make a reservation beforehand they do let you add yourself to their waitlist on Yelp. If you decide to come here meals will cost you at ~$20+ but their clam chowder is only $9 for a bowl, $11 in a bread bowl, and $18 to top it with crab. Great option to get on a gloomy day! I also ordered their fish & chips ($19) and was satisfied with the dish. For $19 I think the portions were a great size and I definitely felt stuffed after. The meal comes with 3 large pieces of beer battered fish that has a crispy outside, side of coleslaw, and nicely thin cut/crisp french fries. The server also brought over some malted vinegar to top if off with. *They also serve complimentary bread/butter that they bake fresh every day For being such a busy place I liked how they had enough servers to handle the lunch rush and the servers were attentive enough but let you have your space during your meal. Overall Fog Harbor is a solid spot to crab any of your seafood needs (fried calamari, clam chowder, whole crab, pasta, and sandwiches) with great views of Alcatraz and the sea lions.",
            "Ohhhhhh boy. This is a good one!After looking through some reviews for some good seafood, we decided on Fog Harbor. We got there and literally had to wait 2 minutes to be seated, which was nice because it was lunch time. The place was nicely decorated and I almost felt like I was on a boat. The waiter we had was so on-point. He was friendly, explained the menu and make excellent recommendations, and he was extremely attentive. We were seated right by the window and had a great view of the bay.  We started off with the award-winning clam chowder, which definitely lived up to our expectations. It's a MUST. It was Dungeness crab season, so we both had to crack one of those big boys open. They were DELISH. I'm glad they bibbed us and provided gloves, because it was def a bit of a messy experience, lol. I also got to try a non-alcoholic wine soda, which was surprisingly pleasant. Tasty and not too sweet, which is how I like my wine. Highly recommended if you're in the Wharf and want some fresh grub that will not disappoint. 5/5 with decor, service, and most importantly food!",
            "Great place for dinner. Nice view of the pier and cozy ambiance. I recommend putting your name down on the wait list ahead of time as it gets really busy. Our server was really attentive, regularly checked in to see if we had everything we needed. I wasn't sure if we're were supposed to get a bread basket, but I noticed it on other tables as I was walking out. The drinks were good.   If you like a lighter cocktail, the Alcatraz Escape is a nice drink. My friend had the recommended wine and she liked it too.  The food came out pretty quickly and tasted great. The calamari was really crispy and the potion was decent. The soup wasn't bad but they're wasn't much since it's in a bread bowl.  Unless you plan in eating the entire bread bowl, I'd recommend getting it on a regular bowl.  The seared scallop and crab risotto was awesome highly recommend it.  The kitchen helped spilt our order into 2 separate plates, since we told the server we were sharing,  so that was nice. Overall, if you're in the SF area, I'd recommend eating at this restaurant.",
            "Visiting San Francisco for business for a couple of days and wanted the Wharf experience, even though it was cold, raining, and we worked long hours so the view was just dark and dreary. Stopped into Fog Harbor based on Yelp reviews and a magazine recommendation.The entire group got the Garlic Roasted Whole Dungeness Crab. The crab was fantastic, with a nice presentation. The service was excellent, and the location (despite the weather and late-night arrival) was perfect for a business tourist wanting a memorable San Francisco meal. I especially appreciated that the waiter treated our wine bottles with care, chilled by the bottle at the table and poured for us rather than brought out warm by the glass.My only complaint may be an unwarranted one given that I ordered whole dungeness crab and it's a dish I'm not used to ordering. There was enough butter/grease on the plate that I could tip the plate and dump out a cup of it. I love that the dish was buttery, and appreciated the drawn butter in a cup on the side (and dunked my succulent crab meat in it), but the potatoes, the green beans; everything was drenched in buttery grease. A light coating should have sufficed, but I'm not joking when I say that my plate had a pool of it underneath all the food. My stomach didn't feel all that great for about 24 hours after my meal - kind of the same feeling I have after eating movie theater popcorn where the butter was a bit heavy handed. I am a butter and garlic glutton, but this was too much even for me.I would definitely recommend a stop into Fog Harbor for anyone visiting San Francisco. The sea lions aren't all that far away, either, and the boardwalk shopping (although it was all closed when we showed up) looks really fun.",
            "My expectations for this place was not too high since it's a well-known touristy restaurant. But it blew mine and my bf's tastebuds away!I made a reservation on a Monday night at 7:30 pm for a table next to the window. Luckily, the sun was just setting so we could see the beautiful view. This place was packed on a Monday night so make sure you make a reservation beforehand so you don't have to wait!Our waiter, Curtiss (I think?) was attentive, helpful, and super funny lol. He recommended some pasta dishes that aren't on the menu. Thanks to him, we got the Linguine with crab, scallops, and shrimps in garlic butter sauce and cheese (parmesan? I'm not 100% sure but I LOVED it and I usually hate cheese). The sauce had a smoky, buttery, garlicky taste to it and the pasta itself was cooked al-dente to perfection! The scallops stood out to me because it was seared on top but soft underneath. This was by far the best pasta dish we've ever had!!! I was sad when it was over lol. We also got the Cioppino (crab, scallops, shrimp, mussels, and clams). This was good as well, although the sauce was a tiny bit too salty for my taste. All the seafood tasted fresh and well seasoned. The restaurant gives out complimentary sourdough bread with butter (loved it!)The best thing though, besides the food, view, and service, was that they split the entrees for us. So instead of giving us one plate of Cioppino, one plate of Linguine, and empty plates to share --- they divided each portion in half into two plates! We never experienced this at any other restaurant. All in all, get that Linguine pasta with crab, scallops, and shrimp!! Ask for it since it's not on the menu!!",
            "First stop in San Francisco for an early lunch. Started off with the clam chowder which was wonderful. Also tried the angus sliders with caramelized onions & shallot aioli & ahi tuna poke with mango, avocado, sesame soy sauce & wasabi aioli. Everything we tried was spectacular. Our server, Edgar was very sweet & attentive & the view is extraordinary!",
            "It's difficult to write a review when a meal puts your brain in the fog and leaves you at a lost for words. This establishment prepares food that turns words like tasty, delicious and mouth watering into dumb cliches. Fog Harbor literally made my sense of taste fire on all cylinders. I enjoyed every bite of my food and had to resist the temptation of using my fingers to dip into the remaining saucy residue left over on the plate.A full bar awaits those who desire to wet their whistles with perfectly crafted cocktails that can create a fog over the bay on a clear day, or sunshine through the rain. I feel like I'm rambling here. So let me spare you from a lengthy review filled with meaningless cliches. Meaningless because as I stated earlier, the food and service served up at this establishment goes beyond what words can describe.",
            "This place has definitely lived up to the hype on their clam chowder - one of the best I've had. Honestly, I think it's better than Pike's place clam chowder in Seattle. We had the one with the lobster on top and that was phenomenal- fresh tasting lobster with that creamy, thick broth, and tender clams. Our server was super nice too, he took time with us to give us recommendations and even saved us some money because originally we were going to get the clam chowder bread bowl but he told us the bottomless bread is the same type and we could just use that! We also ordered the mussels and penne, crab, and a seafood medley with lobster, scallops and I think more crab mixed with a yummy red sauce. And we were celebrating my husband's birthday that weekend - they did not hesitate to offer us one of their desserts on the menu for free. Ambience: during the holidays, they have Xmas decorations everywhere and lights. Perfect for a romantic dinner. Service: our waiter was awesome, he was very accommodating and helpfulFood: phenomenal",
            "O...M...G... This was so good. Had a glass of Malbec to top it off. Worth every penny...",
            "Utilized yelp waitlist and only waited less than 10 mins to be seated. I forget our waitress' name, but she was short with curly hair. She was funny and nice.Our waitress brought over sourdough rolls with butter, this was delish (esp the butter). We started with a bowl of clam chowder to share. It had a good amount of clams in each scoop and was very good.Our waitress dropped off bibs for the mess we're about to encounter and she put the bibs on for us! Not sure if she was supposed to but i found it amusing. Thought she might be cracking the crab shells for us but we weren't that lucky. LolWe ordered the lobster roll which came on a buttery bun served with house made potato chips. The lobster could've had a little more butter/taste, but still good. The chips were just ok.. not much taste. We also got the seafood platter for 1 to share. There were about 6 pieces of each seafood (shrimp, mussels and clam) with a piece of crab. They were all soaking in an amazing buttery herb garlic sauce which we dipped the lobster roll in. The sauce was sooo delicious!!Our check came with a biscoff cookie for each person and a coupon at the bottom of the receipt for 20% off our coffee purchase at the biscoff store (downstairs).",
            "Came to San Francisco for my birthday weekend. While searching for places to eat my bestfriend found Fog Harbor. Boy am I happy she did, she made reservations for Friday, the night before my birthday. Jessica was our waitress and was very energetic, professional, and knowledgeable of her job. The food, and drinks was so delicious and the service we received from Jessica was impeccable. Fog Harbor is a place you should definitely visit to eat, when you come to San Francisco. You must have there \"Award winning Clam Chowder with added fresh crabmeat\"",
            "One of the best Fish houses I have ever been to! I made reservations on Yelp and under \"special requests\" I mentioned it was my husband's birthday. We came a little earlier from the reservation time and the table was not ready. So we sad at the bar and order some drinks while waiting. I had an \"Alcatraz Escape\" a rum cocktail similar to a rum runner and my husband got the \"Patron Margarita.\"The restaurant has a beautiful view and is located on Pier 39 on a second floor. The host took us to our table at our reservation time. She was friendly and polite. The menu has appetizers, seafood, salads, pasta, and steaks. I saw they have an \"Award winning clam chowder\" so we had to try it! We got two cups and some calamari as starters. The clam chowder was amazing! Really good and unique. The calamari was delicious as well; big serving. We had a bottle of Viognier with the appetizers and we ordered the \"Seared scallops with Crab risotto\" for me and the \"Garlic roasted Crab\" for my husband. Our server also brought us two delicious bread buns. They were warm and delicious! The food came out promptly and everything was beyond my expectations. My food was just fantastic! The scallops were a little too small but they were cooked perfectly and the crab risotto was the best! It had so much crab! The roasted crab was great as well it came with fingerling potatoes. Excellent. As we finish our meal I was a little disappointed because there was no sign of dessert or anybody coming to sign happy birthday to my husband. So we decided to order a \"Tiramisú\" I have no problem with paying off the dessert or anything but since I put it in the reservation I thought they would show some type of appreciation. I had some birthday candles on my purse (luckily!) So I asked our waitress for a lighter so that I could sign happy birthday. She cane and wish a happy birthday and smile and when she brought the bill they gave us the dessert for free. I know it was not her fault. Whoever check the reservation didn't inform her. Overall, I love the food and the restaurant. I give them 4.4 stars and definitely looking forward to come back and try more delicious food.",
            "October 2018Well I don't get to go here too often but I'm always so pleased and happy when I do.First off their service is top notch even when they are packed and I've been here for both. We came during the evening hour dinner rush and still did not have to wait too long, 20 minutes.I ordered my favorite dish. Clam chowder with Dungeness crab in the sourdough bread bowl of course. Let me tell you I'd make the 8 plus hour drive to arrive here each day just to eat this dish! If only I were not just a mere human, I would no hesitation. That's how good their clam chowder and sourdough bread is!We had a lovely evening watching the sunset and chatting by candlelight. Visiting Mari is always an adventure.",
            "Came here with my family during the summer. For being in a tourist area, their food is really good with fresh seafood. I ordered the clam chowder with dungeness crab in a bread bowl which was good but I really wanted to try the filet mignon. My sister got the Dungeness Crab Louie Salad and I really liked it. I don't remember what everyone else got but we all enjoyed our meal. I suggest asking for a table by the window so you can see the beautiful view. It also gets pretty packed during the weekends so expect a wait if you did not make reservations. They also validate your first hour of parking.",
            "Usually most pier restaurants are overpriced and crowded, with mediocre foods. This restaurant has it all: a beautiful view of the bay and Golden Gate Bridge, fresh seafood, and excellent menu. Make sure to use Yelp to reserve your spots ahead of time to avoid the long wait. Here's what we ordered.Crab ceviche. Other Yelp reviews praised this as a must order dish. It's great, but it's not the best. There's a lot of crab meat, but there's way the onions don't bring out the taste.New England Clam Chowder. Excellent. Not too creamy, plenty of clam meat. Tastes just right.Fish and Chips. I had better up in Seattle. It's decent, but not worth the full price. If possible, just order the kid's menu fish and chips and you save some money. The major difference is an extra fried fish piece and some coleslaw. Save your $11.Steamed clams. Excellent! The sauce is a bit different. They flavored it with a Cajun twist. It's not your typical white wine sauce. I love it!Salmon. Wow, I usually don't like salmon but the way they cooked it here, it's so amazing! It's grilled and seasoned to perfection. The light sauce adds a lot of flavors.Bread and Butter. The bread was fresh and warm. The butter simply melts on the bread.  Be careful not to fill your appetite with bread while you're waiting for your food.Sliders. Okay, nothing to brag about. I would skip it next time around.Overall, I would come back here again. There's a lot more amazing selections we didn't have a chance to order. Maybe next time. For #Thinsulin fans, there's green light foods for the Active Phase.",
            "Exceptional service! Our waitress knew every beer on the menu by heart, giving us recommendations and even offering free beer replacements if the flavor was too strong. The clam chowder was great and pretty filling. It's not the best I've had, but everyone has their own preferences. I should try it with the crab next time. Recommendstion: Salmon/Mixed grill. I loved the salmon! It was sooo soft and tender that it flaked off to the slightest poke. The place is a bit pricey, but you should treat yourself and experience the bougieness of pier 39."

            "Booking reservations for this place was incredibly easy. It's not too overly crowded. I booked the night before and got a reservation for 12 during their busy brunch hours. First off, I just want to say how much I appreciate the effort and love that went into this place. Everything from the hardwood flooring to the decor to the food, was just phenomenal. Such a gorgeous brunch place with ample amount of outdoor seating. It has a more rustic vibe but with a lot of natural lighting. So great for a sunny day!My boyfriend and I got the loco moco, the French toast, and the fried chicken eggs benedict. My favorite one was the loco moco. The beef patty was extremely well seasoned and they paired with kimchi to give it a nice kick along with the gravy! It was my favorite thing there and I highly suggest you to try it. Service was also great! Everyone was super friendly and accommodating. I love places like these and we need more of it in San Francisco. The aesthetic of this restaurant was perfection.",
            "Fusion food is always a great choice for brunch! I've always heard about Surisan but had never gone because it's in such a busy location with terrible parking, but my friend was having her birthday brunch here so it was a good excuse to try it out.The service was really good, considering we had a huge group of around 18 people. They were very diligent on getting our orders and making sure our drinks were always filled up.I got a vanilla latte, the Dolsot with bulgogi, + shared the Millionaire's Bacon flight with friends. The dolsot came in a super hot sizzling cast iron pan, with rice, veggies and delicious umami bulgogi! The gochujang sauce on the side was super spicy and well balanced as well. It was such a huge meal, I had lots of leftovers for dinner the same night. :) The bacon flight was also amazing! Tender, juicy, thick cut bacon in 4 different flavors. I wouldn't say the flavors varied all that much, it was honestly hard to notice, so maybe just order a side of the Millionaires bacon rather than the flight because its cheaper. Most of my friends got cocktails and bottomless mimosas, which were always being refilled diligently by the wait staff.I definitely want to come back sometime to try their other brunch menu items + their dinner menu. Very trendy & delicious, however pretty pricey. This ended up being around a $45 meal, but fairly worth it because of the company I had with me. :)",
            "The worst restaurant ever in the U.S. Very Dishonest businessl practice. They absolutely had no care about their customers. The waitress didn't honor our reservation, she refused to seat us even we arrived 5, 6 mins earlier than our reservation time. We had made a reservation on OpenTable for March 5th, 2019, 2:30pm, Tuesday. I even called the restaurant to ask the waitress where can we park and told her that we have a reservation with OpenTable and are on our way driving to the restaurant now when we were driving heading to the restaurant from the Outer Sunset to fisherman's Wharf. When we arrived we told the waitress we had a reservation with Opentable for 2:30pm, and the waitress told us that they are closed, their last seating is at 2:15pm. But we told her that your last seating on Opentsble is at 2:45pm that we saw and we showed her the phone to let her see that. It was 2:25pm at that time, it is only 10 mins passed their (inaccurate) last seating time. We told her there's no way that you don't honor our reservation since we had made a reservation on Opentable for 2:30pm and the time we arrived were at 2:25pm. The reservation was confirmed on the app and by email. We even told the waitress that we will eat faster and finish before 3pm. At that time, there were still 3 tables eating at the restaurant. But she still refuse to let us do dine-in and force us to get take out instead. The waitress is absolutely the coldest waitress we have seen and experienced since living in the U.S. for so long. Does the 10 mins passed their (inaccurate) last seating time really make a big impact/ difference on them?? We also asked to speck to the manager, but the waitress didn't let us to talk to the manager about this either.We were forced to get take out instead. We were so....so..angry and confused at that time but still ordered two meals for take out. And later when we returned home, I received a email from OpenTable said that we didn't show up for our reservation...., which means what, they marked us as No Show to avoid paying their $2.00 reservation fee. But we already spent $57 ordered for take out for one Crab Benedit and one Loco Moco. And we showed up to the restaurant 5 or 6 mins earlier than our reservation time and got being turn away. Very dishonest business practice, not sure is the waitress who worked there's intention to mark us as No Show or other staffs, but this is absolutely unacceptable and unforgivable. We were absolutely angry at that point even until weeks later when writing this review we still cannot cool off our anger. The food we got were bland and nothing special at all. The food portion were very small given the price they charged. The crab benedit tasted bad, the crab texture was very dry, cheap quality of crab meat that they used, the crab portion were very little, it costed $24.00 before tax for this fish. The Loco Moco were bland and nothing impressive at all. The place is absolutely over-rated and is a tourist trap. Expensive and the worst customer service we have experienced ever!!! Absolutely not worthy for us to spent half an hour to drive from Outer Sunset to Fisherman's Wharf and paid for expensive parking to dine there and finally being turned away!!! We will never never never again return to this restaurant Sursian, will never never again to give our hard working money to support them. The customer service there were absolutely horrible.",
            "I ordered to go and opt for the Spicy Pork Bap $19 and the Millionaires Bacon $8Potatoes were good and the spicy pork was delicious with its spicy paste with it, millionaires bacon was great a bit pricey but I'd visit with a friend again",
            "Great brunch, great Korean food, and lovely outdoor patio if you are lucky enough to visit on a sunny day. We got the Bulgogi Bap and the Country Benedict. The bulgogi bap was the highlight. You can never go wrong with bulgogi. The KFC chicken is also very good but obviously as the name suggests, battered and deep fried! We thought the lattes were also very good. Service was good, food was brought out quite quick and the line up went by fast too. Overall a lovely experience and we will be back. I really want to try the famous millionaires bacon!",
            "Amazing breakfast! We got the Surisan scramble, Korean fried chicken Benedict, the millionaires bacon & the bottomless mimosas. They are serious about the bottomless mimosas! You won't find the bottom. The food also in INCREDIBLE. Well thought out + balanced dishes - they're so good.",
            "We ordered the Petite buns and k tacos! They were both tasty, we both liked the petite buns (a pork/noodle dish with small bao like buns on the side) more. The tacos came with three salsas, one which was very tasty spicy jelly. The portions of both were generous and enough to get full. This place is one of our friends favorites for brunch and very good for dinner so we were excited to try it. The staff from host to servers were all very polite and just the right amount of attentive.",
            "I've had Surisan in my bookmarks for awhile now because i saw such great reviews about their breakfast/brunch. My boyfriend and i were in the city and he said he was craving bimbimbap so i was like ooo let's go here! It was 5pm on a Friday they had just opened for dinner service and we were first to be seated. The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful! We were obsessed with the decor. It was simple yet so nice! We were really hungry so decided to order 3 entrees to share. *Bulgogi nachos*K.F.C Bap*K-TacosPortions were reasonable and everything tasted amazing! It wasn't too pricey for what you get, definitely worth it. Not to mention service was amazing! Everyone was so attentive, once our water was running low they came to fill it right away without us having to ask. Would definitely come back!",
            "It was spur of the moment that we decided to check this place out. We figured it was brunch time and we're in the area so might as well try something new. I'm so glad that we made the right decision by coming here. I put us on the waitlist and it said almost an hour wait, maybe not even thirty minutes goes by and we came up to the host to check in to let them know we're on the list, the host was very nice and said they had a table for two available and they could seat us right away, score! The place it self I'd say is pretty trendy and in a great location. Love that they have a full front patio seating so that on a nice warm sunny day you can eat and enjoy the weather. Staff is friendly and work fast, the food comes out really quick and is delicious. We ordered the California Burger, K-Burrito and what was probably the best French toast I've ever had, the Stuffed blue berry French toast with fresh strawberries, blue berries and melted caramel. Overall it was a great experience, yes it's a bit noisy but hey the food is so good you tune everything out, at that point nothing mattered but the delicious food. I look forward to coming back for more and perhaps trying out the dinner menu as well.",
            "I'm in San Francisco for a few days for work travel.  I'm staying on the Pier and wanted something different from Hog Island or all the other usuals that folks visit while in the area.As I was Yelping, this Korean inspired restaurant popped up with some pretty rave reviews.  Of course, I had to stop in since it was just a 5 minute walk from my hotel.When I arrived, I was greeted with a warm welcome from the front of the house.  He quickly sat me down, gave me some water, and a menu to review.I ordered the Mango Poke Salad and the Dolsat.  Both dishes were out of this world!  The Mango Poke Salad had the right amount of dressing, spices, and flavors.  I never knew mango would compliment poke so well.  I finished everything before my entree came out.The Dolsat was delivered from the kitchen so impressively -- smokin' hot and still crackling as it came out in its clay pot.  You can choose your own protein (chicken, beef, seafood, or tofu) and it's nicely topped with a fried egg.I'll definitely return the next time I'm in town for leisure.",
            "This restaurant combines two of my favorite foods: korean and brunch. I made a reservation the day before for Sunday afternoon brunch. They seated us right away and service was very fast. I recommend you make a reservation ahead of time because lines can get as long as 2 hours on Sundays! I tried the boosted jook and blueberry stuffed French toast with a side of eggs and millionaires bacon. Both these 2 dishes were AMAZING and I highly recommend them both. If you are a fan of asian porridge go for the boosted jook because it was a type of porridge that I have never tried before. If you're a fan of typical \"American\" breakfasts go for the French toast (highly recommend getting a side of eggs and bacon)!",

Screw those fancy ass restaurants and the impossible waits this is the jam y'all!Korean food + breakfast - I'm sorry, sign me up and take my money!Surisan is right off the Fisherman's Wharf and what a delight to be here on a Sunday morning for bottomless mimosas --- yaassss $20 I will drink (only downside you have 90 mins to chug, challenge accepted). Make reservations as the line was long for those who didn't, but I did notice when we were leaving around 1:30 it cleared up by a lot so I guess if you want lunch you are good to go? We ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice (a staple, duh), Blackstone Eggs Breakfast (fire!) and K.F.C. cause why not? I gobbled it all faster than I could slow down and appreciate everything. I was hungry but more so just excited at how cool this modern, Korean fusion was. The flavors blended perfectly. The holiday sauce with the K.F.C. was on point! The service was fast and you get your food with a reasonable amount of time. Everyone around us too that ordered like a s**t ton also got their stuff pretty fast! I'll be back for some more bottomless and for a dinner time meal as well.",
            "Great location for this Korean fusion brunch- a good distance from the touristy area. I recommend getting reservation if you can because our party of waited for 45mins on a Sunday (not the worst). The seafood pancake was packed with lots of seafood and accompanied with a tasty dipping soy sauce. I also had one of the best dumplings soup here! The dumpling wrappers were so soft that cradled the flavorful pork. The kimchi locomoco is also a safe option and was comforting.We also had the bacon flight which all has a sweet taste (not for me). I definitely recommend the matcha mojito. Very delicious, easy drink.",
            "We came here for dinner last saturday for my friends birthday, we probably didn't need reservations as they had plenty of seating, but now we will know for next time. They seem to be really popular for brunch, so I will have to come back and try their brunch menu, but their dinner items were pretty fantastic as well.  We ordered 3 appetizers to share, the korean fried sweet and soy sauce chicken, millionaires bacon ( must order ), salmon roll.  The soy sauce chicken was really crispy and the chicken was super tender!! It also had no bones which I was really happy about because it made it easy to share.  I ordered the seafood stew which came with a large cup of rice right in the middle. The majority of my group ordered the bulgolgi fried rice, one order of the bimbimbap, and one order of the pork buns.  My dish was served in a very large hot stone bowl, and was a joy to eat.  It wasn't too salty and had a really yummy seafood flavor.  The pork buns were also really delicious, they came with 5 steamed buns and spicy pork and japchae.  This dish was a lot larger than we expected and was a decent amount of food. I will be back for brunch, since it looks like their brunch is really popular.   Parking in this area is so not fun, but you might get lucky at night and find some street parking.",
            "PSA $20 bottomless mimosas for brunch.Food was 5 stars but my experience there yesterday was maybe like a 3.5 so I'm giving this place 4 stars. Food - Great brunch especially if you're insanely hungry, because the portions are massive. I couldn't decide between the Korean brunch items and the regular egg brunch items, but in the end I decided to get the Surisan scramble because it came with Millionaire's bacon which apparently (I just learned) is a big deal. It's like this thick, juicy, slightly sweet piece of bacon. Highly recommend the Surisan scramble if you love eggs and bacon. It also comes with a shitload of other stuff too so it's definitely worth whatever price it was. You also have to get a matcha latte here - they're thick and foamy and not too sweet. Dining experience - This was no one's fault but I was still kinda pissed. The Yelp waitlist told us to come an hour after I got in line, and my whole party showed up on time only to be told that we had to wait another 50 minutes. There was no room inside and it was RAINING outside, so we stood outside in the rain and we are expecting pneumonia soon so stay tuned. I asked a server and they said the waitlist was taking longer than usual because it was raining and therefore all the outdoor seating (which was like 1/3 of the restaurant) was closed. tldr food is good but don't come if it's raining because you'll have to wait for years outside.",
            "Wow! This place is delicious!! I was a little weary at first because it's in such a touristy part of town but yelp lead us to a great meal. Three of us came for dinner (without a reservation) on a Saturday evening. We were able to get a table within about a half hour. It was rainy out so only the inside was open but the outside patio looked charming. We split the kimchi fried rice, petite buns and the seafood pajun. Everything was fantastic. The food came out hot and fresh and quick! We shared the plates family style which was great because we all got a little of everything. None of us were super hungry that night but we cleared all three plates. The flavors were just so good. The decor was lovely, restrooms were clean and well kept and the staff was friendly and helpful.I can't wait to return here on a future trip to SF, I want to try everything on the menu!",
            "Amazing Benedicts with gorgeous, top-notch presentation and attention to detail. Their Millionaire bacon deserves a shout out, and given its Korean theme, reminds me of smoky, well-executed pork belly. Potatoes were crispy, and although the grilled tomato seemed random, it offered a moist textural balance to the potatoes (like ketchup). And I always love tomatoes, so what the hell. Their Country style Benedict was less stellar but still tasty. Forgo the matcha margarita. Tasted like slightly alcoholic lemonade with whip cream that was very out of place, and was extremely disappointing for an otherwise excellent meal.",
            "The idea of Korean fusion brunch intrigued me so my friends and I decided to check it out while we were in town. After looking at the menu, I was slightly disappointed to find out that the dishes itself were not fusion, instead it was a menu mixed with American brunch and Korean food. I ended up ordering the French toast and it was delicious! Thick flavorful French toast that was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They give you caramel sauce to pour over the French toast which was nice since I'm not a big fan of syrup. I also tried the loco moco and the bacon. Bacon was delicious and highly recommended. I don't usually like regular American bacon but this was nothing like that. It was thick, sweet and tender. Loco moco was decent but nothing special: basically a beef patty over rice.Overall, definitely recommend this place for brunch. Dinner looks great too!",
            "We found ourselves at Surisan flanking the holidays while checking out holiday lights and decorations in the city.   The first time the Sunday after Thanksgiving for brunch and the second just about a month later the weekend after Christmas for dinner.  Although I am a fan of popovers, these fell short for me as they were too dry and dense in comparison to my favorites from Wayfare Tavern.  However, everything else was great.   The loco moco brunch and dolsat brunch with bulgogi were flavorful and perfectly cooked and works for brunch or dinner.  The k-tacos and glazed KFC bap we did have for dinner had just a slight kick without being overpowering which works great for someone who prefers to enjoy the flavors of her meal instead of having my mouth on fire.  I believe they are related to Berkeley Social Club but honestly, I would rather cross the bridge for the food at Surisan as both the service and food was better.",
            "What a hot spot! This place was packed the second I arrived to the moment I left! There's a waitlist if you decide to come for brunch, but please make reservations if you can! My boyfriend and I came here on a Monday and waited for about an hour. Every plate that passed by made me so hungry! So what did we do? We ordered 4 items and devoured it all! No regrets.Chicken Sandwich: 3/5It was a good serving. Crispy Korean fried chicken! It's a little messy to eat cause the toppings were falling off and I think I saw some cheese oozing out when my bf took the first bite. Don't get me wrong, it was yummy, but if you want something more special on the menu, I'd get something else rather than a burger. Spicy Mandu Guk: 4/5This was a \"spicy\" pork dumpling soup. It wasn't spicy at all, but that's ok because I'm not a fan of spicy foods. It totally hit the spot on a chilly day in the city. I loved the clear noodles that were in the soup broth was tasty. I didn't notice anything special about the dumplings, but they were still yummy!Bulgogi Bap: 4/5This rice stone bowl was super hot and delicious! It comes with veggies and bulgogi, a fried egg and a sweet and spicy sauce to mix everything together! There's also a side of potatoes that were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Blueberry Stuffed Crunch French Toast: 5/5THIS WAS THE STAR OF THE SHOW! Omg I am not a fan of sweet breakfast food, but this stoke my heart! It was perfectly fried and crispy, with a sweet and soft center filled with sweet cream cheese and fresh blueberries! Drizzle on that caramel sauce and it's perfect. I literally used the crust to get every drop I could! I would definitely come back again for this!"

            "This place literally has gotten a facelift. I used to go here years ago for happy hours or to meet dates for a drink. But over the years it's become more of a happening spot. I was just there a couple months ago on a Sat night. It was super packed(hardly any place to walk)Downside: it takes a while to get your drinks ordered since it's super packed and it's on the pricier side. But it's worth it.",
            "Finally finally made it here with the boyfriend on a Friday afternoon around 5:30pm. It was super packed, but I was able to snag a high-top table as people were leaving. The sun was out and we stayed for sunset. Absolutely gorgeous view! Perfect place for a post-work drink. I got the Haight- Ashberry with gin, strawberries, and citrus ($16). Yes, it was quite pricey, but so so so good! Sweet, but not overly bearing- which I think the citrus helped with. It was beautifully crafted and I absolutely loved it. My boyfriend got a local craft beer ($9) and the D'blood Orange Margarita ($16), which I tried, and was also beautifully presented and tasted good (but I liked mine better).Overall, definitely pretty pricey (we decided against food because so $$$ and the portions looked small from what we saw. Wish they had more snacks other than beer nuts- maybe like french fries), but you are paying for that view. The drinks are not watered down at all and the service is good for being so busy! Will be back!",
            "The view from THE VIEW is amazing, needless to say!  This super shwaggy restaurant and lounge is a \"must-see\" when you visit SF! The view is located in the Marriott Marquis hotel located within the Union Square neighborhood. When you enter this beautiful hotel, take the elevator up to the top floor and boom...you're there! Luckily I've visited The View Lounge on multiple occasions at different times, on different days. The best time to arrive and get a decent table is...when they open! Lol. If you're smart, make a reservation for a window seat because you will get such an amazing view of the Bay Bridge and city lights. They have self-seating lounge seats and tables near the bar, but like I said they are first come first served and once people score these tables they stay for quite a while. Hint: make a reservation. This spot is a cute date spot. If you're looking to score major first date points - come here!",
            "I think the question we should all be asking ourselves when we are looking for ANY bar is:  Are the drinks strong?At the View, I can attest, yes, indeed they are! I can usually hold down 3, but here, I couldn't even finish my second vodka soda, because- was there even soda in it?! Also, a weird thing: i asked if I could have a grapefruit twist, and server was like, we can't do that. Seriously?! The View in the Marriot Marquis doesn't either a) have grapefruit or b) access to grapefruit (from the kitchen). Ok. Whatever. Sure, i'll buy your overpriced, understocked- basic-bish garnish drinks. (FYI Hyatt regency uses locally sourced products to make new, seasonal drinks- much more inspired than your generic lemon lime.Obviously, the view here is IG worthy, but try not to be too annoying getting your snap to make all your friends jelly.The tuna poke is a hard pass. The server recc it (of course its the most expensive thing on the menu!) And it just was totally bland. Would've been better to just order sashimi- if they had that.And last but not least, wanna hear a funny story? My friends and I, and on a separate occasion, my friends, were actually denied entrance to the hotel! So, when I got up there all by my cute little self, i OF COURSE sent vids and pics to my friends, saying \"I know the secret!\" But the truth is, there is no secret! Just ask a friendlier employee. Doors open at 4 but place is packed withjn the hour. Enjoy!",
            "This aptly named the restaurant was definitely the highlight of my stay in San Francisco. My colleagues and I came here for some after dinner drinks and we were treated to a show, courtesy of both Mother Nature and the Salesforce Tower.We had a 3-top table near the window and I was the only one facing it. In the middle of our conversation, I told my colleagues to stop and turn around to look at the moon. Our visit just happened to coincide with the arrival of the Super Snow Moon, the largest full moon of 2019. We were watching it rise through the clouds like something out of a Hollywood film. It was absolutely beautiful, and we were able to get a ton of great pictures.Even without the lunar theatrics there's still so much to see. The Golden Gate Bridge, beautifully illuminated with brilliantly oscillating lights. The glitter of the lights from the city below. Oh yeah, and the Salesforce Tower. At the top of the building there appeared to be some dancers or acrobats whose shadows were projected on to the illuminated apex of the building. I can't explain it any better than that. You just have to come experience it for yourself.As for the drinks, this place makes a serious Old Fashioned. It's got plenty of bite, and at the same time, the nuances of bitters and orange come together to make one hell of a drink. Great job, bartender.This is an amazing place for a first date... or any date actually. Just don't be surprised if your date is paying more attention to the view than they are to you. It's just that kind of place.",
            "Amazing view but meh service/prices. I always saying try something at least once. I have been here during the day time, sunset, and at all- all have their own beautiful views. This place gets uncomfortably crowded. They don't start crowd controlling until 9pm and it's open seating so first come first serve. I never stay here longer than one drink because it gets a bit loud so having a deep or thoughtful conversation here can be challenging unless you have a seating option where you are sitting next to each other. As I mentions trying it out. There is seating on 3 sides of the floor/bar so finding a table isn't hard- but getting a window view is definitely a steal",
            "This review is long overdue. I came here with a friend on a Saturday night and it was extremely busy. There was not a single place to sit and there was definitely not any places to sit near the infamous large windows. After awkwardly roaming around for about 15 minutes, my friend and I found a small table and were able to sit down. I got the high-rise pom cosmo. Oh man was this drink strong! However, for a drink that is $16, that is exactly what I expected! I only got one drink because this drink was super strong but did the job!We were also hungry so we decided to get the summer harvest flatbread which was $17. This was just ok. I liked the idea of having the assortment of vegetables on the flatbread. However, I felt like many of the veggies on the flatbread were out of season so they were raw. I am so glad I found this little gem of a place in SF. I will definitely be returning but maybe not on a Saturday night so I am able to sit next to the large window!",
            "This place is just where you want to be on your special occasion, be it birthday, date night or just an evening with close friends.The \"view\" through the wide glass windows which go from wall to wall is breathtaking.This place does not take reservations, so it is first come first basis. If you are lucky you get your table immediately or have to wait for a long time. Also that makes it difficult to get the table close to the window. But if you are hanging around for a long time, you can always keep an eye.We were lucky and got a seat at the bar immediately. The place was very crowded on a Saturday evening. We had a couple of drinks: cosmo, blueberry bay, old fashion. My personal favorite is the blueberry bay since I prefer sweeter cocktails.We also ordered the honey bourbon wings and the housemade chips with scallions dip. They dont have a lot of options with food, just some small bites. Overall the ambience and the drinks totally made my friday evening.",
            "This is an amazing location to get a great view of the whole city. We were staying at the Marriott so we came here to have a beer. We were blown away! I recommend coming here earlier if you want to score a seat by the windows. Food and drinks are kind of pricey, but totally worth the amazing view.",
            "Been here a few times, it's usually a great spot to bring tourists to check out the view of SF (hence the name), the drinks are fairly priced for a location like this and the service is usually half decent. I will say last time we went the drinks were definitely worth their dollar in terms of alcohol content so good job bartender! I'll be coming back more just because of that :D. Seating can be a bit hard to find at times but I've never had too much trouble or been left without a table to sit, just have to settle for a table away from the windows sometimes.",
            "Amazing experience!!!Super packed but managed to get a seat at the bar in about ten minutes. The view is spectacular, the service was great especially considering how busy it was, and the crowd is super hip. Now let's talk about the drinks. Hands down some of the most creative and delicious cocktails I have ever tasted. 10/10.",
            "If you're in the city this spot is well worth the wait. Located on the 39th floor of the Marriott hotel on mission, it literally becomes an attraction for everyone after work to grab drinks. Therefore a good time to go will p unable be after 8 when everyone is leaving or before the after work crowd comes. We got pretty lucky and got a seat by the window. The view is super fantastic, you can see the bay bridge from the back part of the restaurant and all the buildings at night. The price is a little steep and I did not see a happy hour. However, that's all very little compared to how beautiful it is here. Also get one of the flat breads if you're hungry. I got the pork belly one and it was filling and delicious.",
            "The lounge is beautiful with great view of the city, the design of the floor glasses is also iconic and classic. But the experience is less legendary, maybe due to its popularity. Came here on Saturday around 6:30 pm, the place was already packed, my friend and I had to sit in the less scenic corner, my drink was way too sweet, I could barely move across the room by 7 pm. And it's not the kind of lively busy, the clientele was, well, a somewhat interesting mix, sometimes I feel like I'm in a crowded off-strip small casino in Vegas.",
            "The View Lounge is located on the 39 floor at the Marriott's Hotel. It is a gorgeous place for date night. Who drink at 4pm? I did! Seriously, come early to view the sunset and find a seat. The place get filled very quickly. I usually can find a seat in both sides of the building. Staff are attentive and parking are hard to find. Maybe you want to take public transportation  to save time?",
            "I went here on a weekday night but the view is well worth it! I can see why they call it \"The View Lounge\" This place is packed, a lot of the crowd are often business people probably staying at the Marriot hotel. The day we went, the place was so crowded, I honestly felt like a sardine in a can. We barely found a place to sit at the bar but luckily found a two seater once someone left! A little expensive but the drinks were extremely strong, maybe even too strong to enjoy...after one drink my friend was tipsy but I guess you're getting your moneys worth!",
            "I've seen this bar on Instagram many times and was finally able to make it up here. (Pun intended) It did not disappoint.Loved everything about this bar - great tunes, amazing view & strong drinks! Also loved the fact that it's on the 39th floor away from the filth of San Francisco grounds. Very much appreciated the bartender remembering my order the 3rd time I went up.",
            "As the name suggests, the view of the SF city from the lounge is amazing! I would recommend to plan your visit such that you get to see the city in daylight and in the nighttime.Highlights:- Good ambiance and seating arrangement.- Drinks were nice.- Appetizers were tasty.- Reasonable pricing for such fancy lounge in SF city.- The View of SF city - aah, it's mesmerizing.Overall, a great lounge to visit in SF city. Would recommend it, specially if you are planning for a date or small celebration.",
            "As soon as I saw the pictures of that amazing window and it's view I knew I had to go.  That window looks straight out of a fantasy story, like one hiding magic on the other side.  But what you get to find out is that the magic is right there, inside the bar.We went on a Friday night, late. They had just did the \"last call\".  I was still able to see the window and the view, but I wanted more.  First reason why they get a good review...  they immediately apologized for the inconvenience (even though it was us who got there late) and proceeded to recommend other places for us to go, all walking distance.  And asked us to please come another day.As luck would have it, we did have time to stop by again on Sunday afternoon before our flight.  We were there, with all our luggage, but managed to get a spot, right at the entrance.  They have so sofas and our luggage fit perfectly without being in anyone's way.  The bar is first come first serve, so whatever table, or seat you see available, take it!  it does get crowded with locals, and tourists alike.  Although, honestly, if I lived there I think I would frequent other places... this is definitely a beautiful spot but mostly because of the novelty of that window, after a while I think it would loose it's enchantment.As I mentioned, we got out seats, looking straight at the bar, and to our right that amazing window.  Inside is dimly lit so you can enjoy the city lights through the window regardless of where you are seated or standing.The server came to us in no time with menus, drinks and they have a nice selection of bar bites to accompany them.  She gave us a minute to decide and was back to take our order, at the same time that she brought us water.I opted for their cucumber mint refresher.  This was exactly that, refreshing.  Clean, simple, and very welcoming after 3 straight days of wine (Napa trip...)  As you can imagine prices are a bit high but not terrible.  Signature drinks cost from $15 - $20.  They also have a full bar, wines, scotch and whiskey, and beers.To snack on something while we killed time before our flight, I ordered the house-made chips.  Generous amount of perfectly crispy and salty chips, with a delicious scallion aioli on the side.  One order was enough for 3 of us.  Drinks, well, those had to be refilled  :pI was happy we got the chance to get the full experience before we left, and see with my own eyes that (magical) window.",
            "Nice bar with great views of the city. Really hard to get a drink because it was just so busy! Loud music and it was also hard to find a place to sit. Would definitely come back because of the views tho.",
            "Our server Cindy was good but service is slow, especially with the drinks. And though the view is quite stunning and the drinks decent, this is more a touristy place with tourist prices for drinks. Parts of the bar was lit too bright, and there are many many people taking selfies."

            "For those who don't know, \"Coqueta\" and/or \"Coquette\" translates to \"Flirt\" in English. And I believe that this word is very fitting for this charming waterfront bar/restaurant.I came here recently for a quick weeknight drink with friends. The place boasted a lively crowd; the space was inviting; the staff was welcoming; and the Bay views were extraordinary. We ordered a round of cocktails which came out in a timely, efficient manner. Since we weren't staying for long, I could only glance at the food/cocktail menu (all of it looked tantalizing). I was totally seduced by this place. And just like a true flirt, I can't wait to come back and see where it leads to next.",
            "Beautiful restaurant right by the water. Service is exceptional and the food is fresh with Spanish flavors. Things that stood out were the Patatas Bravas where they are roasted and infused with garlic and rosemary and then topped with a sauce and slightly crisp to create salted crust. The grilled octopus is very fresh and works with the sauces and veggies. The chorizo is amazing!!The service is exceptional! We made a reservation and sat at the chefs counter. Everyone was very attentive and offered us a bunch of items to try!",
            "This is another Embarcadero restaurant that's been on my bucket list for awhile. Luckily I have a friend that enjoys picking a happy hour spot that's new for me. She likes to vet them ahead of time, and her selection of Coqueta was on-point. Super classy and fun.When I got there, I sat at the bar area on the right-hand side of the restaurant upon walking in. She quickly corrected me when she got there and relocated me to the other side. There was a more sophisticated bar and a swanky outdoor patio. Again, great decision on her part.The cocktails are OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Some of the best cocktails I've had in San Francisco. I had a bourbon-based drink as well as one of their special G&Ts. Very pretty, too. Our bartender was creative when asked to just \"make something.\" That's my favorite.The food wasn't too memorable, which we ordered after a few beverages... we got tapas like octopus, Brussel sprouts, shrimp, potatoes, and croquets. I'd definitely come back here again but have dinner elsewhere first. Great swanky vibe, though. Perfect for a romantic night out.",
            "I love Coqueta--it is one of my first recommendations to anyone visiting the city. The food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable. Take Embarcadero Bart station, walk towards the Ferry Building, and then pass it on the left hand side. You'll find Coqueta with the orange overhang.You can sit in the bar area and see the water, or go inside to the beautiful restaurant. Make a reservation if you can as it does a great business!Can't go wrong with any of the food, even the simplest sounding dishes are incredible. And ask to see the Pinxtos, they are bite sized little treats that are beautiful and tasty.Enjoy!",
            "Everything was delicious and my friend recommended as the best place for tapas in SF. Located at the Embarcadero, the restaurant itself is gorgeous with an outdoor space and the main dining room.We got one of the porrons to share and then a couple of tapas for the table: patatas bravas ($10), pan con tomate with jamon ($15), pulpo a la parilla ($15). The pulpo was definitely the favorite!PS. I came for my birthday and they gave me these cute birthday lollipop cakes complimentary, which was a nice touch!",
            "I had a great experience at Coqueta. Here's a place where you can expect tasty tapas, great seafood, and interesting drinks. The price point is obviously a little bit higher, so the evaluation criteria for me are the quality of the food, the ambience, and the service.I think my favorite dish here was the pork and lamb meatballs. They're really flavorful, and I would give them a 5/5. I don't remember the actual name, but the salmon on bread tapas plate was great, too - another 5/5. I think the paella dish was pretty good, but probably not the best I've ever had. There wasn't a ton of seafood in it. The drinks were made really well, in my opinion. My favorite drink was some sort of variant of a gin and tonic.The ambience is a good fit for the restaurant. It's a cute little building with a cozy inside. The location is great.I think the one area that Coqueta could really improve is the service. It's pretty difficult to get a server's attention. I think they might be slightly understaffed. You can expect to spend a few minutes trying to order a drink. Regardless, I really enjoyed my experience at Coqueta overall and would be happy to go back.",

The chorizo combination is very smokey and tasty.$2.75 Manchego w/ Jamon Serrano and apricot-sherry conserva:Good! I enjoyed the balance of salty jamon with a sweet glaze on top.$10 Patatas Bravas - crispy potatoes w/ salsa and garlic aioli:Good! The neatly arranged plate of small potatoes came arranged in a circle, a dollop of garlic aioli on top of each potato, and with a container of smokey salsa in the center. $10 Croquetas de Pollo - chicharron crusted chicken and English pea croquetas w/ cured oranges:Good! These fried croquetas were breaded and crunchy on the outside, and creamy on the inside. I've not had salty oranges before, but the savoriness and saltiness is not a bad combination.$14 \"Sunny side-up\" Huevo w/ shrimp, crispy potato, garlic chips, pine nuts, chili de arbol and chorizo dressingGood! A beautiful sunny-side up egg sat on top of minced chorizo, and was accompanied with shoestring fries and a handful of shrimp. Our server broke apart the egg and mixed it into the chorizo and potatoes. It is a nice breakfast combination, albeit rather oily.$15 Mar y Montana, \"Sea and Mountain\" - Iberico lardo melted over sea urchin with lomo IbericoGreat! A pair of palm-sized toast with creamy uni and beautifully crisp lomo, topped with some rosemary. The bread was a little hard, but the uni and sausage made up for that.$4 Trio de Postres Pintxos - Salted Caramel with Pimenton, Passion Fruit Gelatina, Thyme Sugar Chocolate Fuet:Not so good. I was curious to try dessert pintxos, but the combination of flavors were strange to me, and most of them stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth.I  enjoyed all the savory dishes, though I'm not sure if there is much of a wow factor, considering the prices of dishes. The service was very friendly and easygoing. Overall, I give it a 7/10.",
            "Love this spot! I most recently stopped by with a group of girl friends for a holiday get together. Our server was great hosting a large group and was extremely mindful of everyone's allergies and dietary restrictions. Unfortunately, I can't remember exactly what we ordered, but everything was pretty good. The server gave us great suggestions, and really made the experience a wonderful one.I also love stopping by for happy hour. They have a nice area outside overlooking the Bay and the Embarcadero, which is perfect for warm days.",
            "I loved this place way more than I expected to love it. We headed to the city for my birthday weekend celebration and I picked a couple of spots to enjoy the food! I really like tapas dishes because I want to try a bunch of stuff without having to commit to large dishes. This place did not disappoint.Out waitress was awesome ( I wish I wrote her name down because she rocked!) She made sure we had drinks during the meal and also gave us the really real when we were on the fence about some of our choices.  If I had to pick one item that I would go back to- Sunny side up huevos were amazing (see pic). The Croquetas de Pollo are also a not to be missed item. We ate in the main dining area and wanted to enjoy the view. The cool part was that we were able to order another drink after dinner and hang out outside by the bar and enjoy the gorgeous view. This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem in San Francisco!",
            "Came here on a heavy rainy day and was super impressed!Style:Located on Pier 5 with ocean view, I love the vibe inside the restaurant. They also have a outdoor bar with even better view! Service:Our waiter is amazing and food comes in a good pace. He offered us to do a half cheese board and mini skews to create a rest tapa comb. Also great recommendations on the two rounds of cocktails. Food:Love almost everything we ordered!Full Cheese Board - must order since it got the bombers blue cheese everrr!! Octopus - very rich and creamySalmon Tapa - 1 order came with 2 pieces, very satisfying bitesMini skews - it'd be better if they serve upon table size so we can pick it outPotato bites - delicious yet gets me full too fastShrimps - cooked perfect with shell removed; extra creamy",
            "Went there last night for special occasion. We showed up 30 minutes early, my mistake. But hostess sat us anyway! Great start to what ended up to be great experience at Coqueta.We are almost always wary of Spanish restaurants. Based on experience the food can taste microwaved or frozen. Coqueta is not one of those places, thankfully. TBH this was one of the best, top 3 Spanish food we've had. And we have had Spanish food from different countries, cities. Loved the pulpo/ octopus. Croquetas were so fresh tasting. Patatas bravas.. brava! Brussels sprouts, mushrooms. All so delicious. We got so full that we didn't order main dish. Next time though we'll definitely get the paella (order in advance, takes 40 mins). Oh and just lovely wines yum. I had cocktails. The Sea Air margarita though not Spanish was absolutely delicious!!! The Spanish inspired Maraskino was yum. I'll have those cocktails again.In summary- um go !!!",
            "I have to say, this was truly one of the most enjoyable lunches I've ever had alone. The original plan was to meet my cousin here, but she had gotten sick. Since dining with my cousin have always turned out to be a gastronomic delight, Coqueta piqued my interest. I decided to keep the reservation she had made for us, and flew solo. Carlos. You are the man! Super nice bartender who makes excellent drinks and really knows his stuff. I asked him what he could make for me if I was an Old Fashioned kinda girl. His answer: Championship Policy, named after local legend Carmen Policy, former president of the 49ers. It's basically a Scotch Manhattan on the rocks with a nice smokiness to it. It was perfect, so I had two.While the choice of cocktails was easy enough for me, what to eat was another matter. Since my buddy Carlos didn't mind me sitting at the bar for awhile, I decided to start with 4 bite-size skewers and see how it went from there. Boquerones is a dainty little thing of white anchovies, pearl onion, pepper, and olive. Full of flavor! Huevos de Codorniz is quail egg w/ pickled mustard seed, and cured ham. Such a delightful taste! Manchego cheese with cured ham, drizzled with apricot & sherry. One is not enough! Tortilla de Espinacas is a spinach tortilla w/ cheese. Well that was all good, but what to get next? Mar y Montaña. My favorite! It is cured pig's fat melted over sea urchin on toasts topped with cured pork loin. Ohmygod. Ohmygod. Ohmygod. Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm. So good I ordered another one. Unfortunately, these cute little delicacies only made me crave for something a little bigger. So I ordered Pulpo a la Parilla which is octopus that's been grilled to perfection with fingerling potatoes. This was scrumptious. So tender, with just the right seasonings. So why the 4-star then? Well after dropping $100 on lunch, I had to grab something to eat an hour later in Chinatown. Would I come here again though? You bet, except next time I'll eat something BEFORE I come here to eat :-)",
            "Embarcadero has a lot of dining options but I always end up eating the traditional chowder or lobster roll. Too many dining options but not really sure what to try so I asked the opinion of my yelp foodie friend, John . He recommended this place which is located not far from the Ferrry Building Marketplace.Before arriving at this place, I already had small bites from other places so I didn't really intend to indulge on a heavy meal. I'm glad that I dropped by during happy hour when they have some great deals. I chose to seat at the bar area where there's a good view of the port of San Francisco.I ordered one of their open face sandwiches, a Salmon Ahumado with smoked salmon, queso fresco and truffle honey. This was incredibly delicious. The smoked salmon wasn't salty unlike most that I've tried in other places. It's actually on a sweeter side with the addition of honey. I enjoyed every single bite of it. I also had Limonada, a sparkling lemonade with rosemary and blueberry. This drink was perfect for that sandwich. The lemonade washes away the fish taste off your mouth. It's simply refreshing.",
            "Wow, I was so blown away by this place.I first visited Coqueta a few years ago when my friend mentioned they had really pretty gin & tonics. I guess you could say that's what they're known for!Last week, when my boyfriend asked me to help pick a place for date night, I gave him my \"San Francisco\" bookmarks list (all $$$+, oops) -- Coqueta was ideal location-wise, so we made a reservation for 6:45pm, dining table, on a Sunday night.First of all, service was ON POINT. Our server (gah, I'm terrible with names and cannot recall hers) was amazing -- knew the seasonal menu like the back of her hand, and recommended all of the right dishes. Here's what we ordered... items with astericks are MUST GETS:1 - ***Salmon Ahumado*** (open smoked salmon sandwich) - this was essentially a mini lox bagel. Mini as in the size of a Bagel Bite. It was MUY DELICIOSO. (I'm practicing Spanish as I'm going to Tulum next week.)2 - Ensalada de Kale (kale salad) - this was my least favorite. Not because it's a salad, but because it has goat cheese (Cana de Cabra from Cowgirl Creamery) in it, which I'm not a fan of.3 - ***Croquetas de Pollo*** (chicken croquettes) - the croquettes themselves were delicious, but they each came with a small slice of a citrus fruit topped with a pickled pepper on a toothpick. Like a little palate cleanser to go along with and cut down on the richness. Thoughtful and fantastic.4 - Albondigas a la Feria (duck & pork meatballs) - these were good, but would skip next time to try something else on the menu.5 - ***Pluma*** (pork shoulder loin w honey-chili glaze) - no words to describe, really. The pork is melt-in-your-mouth. The honey-chili glaze comes on the side - in its own bottle - so you can put as much on as you want. I drowned my pork in it and wanted to put the bottle in my purse to take home with me, but I decided against it AKA didn't have enough to drink. ;)6 - Setas al ajillo (wild mushrooms) - these were a side dish to our main dish (bish?). They were a little too salty for me.7 - ***Manchego cheesecake*** - this came with two bites and a few pieces of caramel popcorn. It was the perfect size -- I wouldn't have enjoyed more than a bite.8 - ***Bizcocho de Arroz con Leche*** (leche cake with huckleberries and ice cream) - just get it.Everything that we ordered was SO flavorful. At one point, my bf even mentioned that everything we ordered was so flavorful to the point where they were too intense... he could've done with a bowl of plain white rice, lol.My bf got a glass of red wine while I had two gin & tonics. The wine came in a porron, which is a Spanish wine pitcher -- it has two openings: one is the good ol' pouring-into-a-glass end, and the other is pointed and meant to pour directly into your mouth. Wow, so authentic! The gin & tonics were as beautiful as I had remembered them to be. (Hey, at least I can remember visuals!)Dinner came out to a little over two bills, which was a lot more than we wanted to spend, but it was worth it! Hopefully will come back for happy hour so my bf doesn't regret taking me out again~",
            "I don't think this place needs another 4-star review... but I'm going to give it anyways... Came here for my Dad's Father's Day / Birthday dinner with the fambam... definitely make a reservation b/c it's packed! Ambiance: love the decor and the openness of the place. Staff was friendly from the start, which I truly appreciate despite them being slammed and busy. I don't remember the rest of my family's orders but I most definitely remember this: house-cured Olives and Marcona almonds -- we ordered it a lot! I still drool over those olives... I don't know what they did but OMG, they were so good, especially when paired with good delicious wine (which was recommended to us by their sommelier!) I remembered my parents loved the paella and honestly, I just enjoyed how each member of my family was truly enjoying themselves. Good food, good service, good company... well worth every penny spent! My family and I became a fan, which I think we might be visiting this place again. To the management and staff - job well done during Father's Day weekend. Everything was seamless and as a customer, your staff kept a friendly face!",
            "This place has a gnarly wait, and can often be around 2+ hours if you are there on the weekend. The bar area on the side serves food as well, and it is open seating. I would recommend the bar area instead of the restaurant, because there is a much shorter wait. The bar area also serves food. I'm not sure if it was the exact same menu, but my guess would be that it is since we would order paella, sandwiches, sides, and other food items from the bar. My favorite dishes are the salmon sandwich, patatas bravas, and pluma. I didn't care too much for the abondigas here.  The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is that it is very cramped, and their service is subpar. They give you the feeling that they really do not care about you, and want people to be in and out as fast as possible. Be ready to overhear the conversations next to you, regardless of whether you choose to sit in the bar or the restaurant. I've sat in both before, and neither was better in terms of having more privacy. The first time when I visited and sat in the restaurant, the server reminded us that there were other patrons waiting for a table when she handed us the bill when we were not even finished with our food yet. Some of our dishes had barely been on the table for 15 minutes before she did this. I am a very considerate diner and will not lounge long after I am done eating, especially if the restaurant is busy. However, I thought this was crossing the line. I returned for a second time only because this restaurant is very close to the Exploratorium, which is where I needed to go to for right after dinner. We opted for the bar this time, and of course, the server was also in a rush. He literally told us \"go, go, go\" while pointing when a table opened up in the corner. He also asked my group to move tables after we already were settled and received our drinks to make room for a larger party. Overall, I wouldn't make an effort to eat here. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area that will treat you better, and have food that is just as good.",
            "This review is only for the bar and happy hour. I can see why everyone comes here for the drinks. They aren't just pretty, but also taste good. My friend and I came here around 6pm with no reservation, luckily the bar still had some tables left. We ordered drinks, a cheese plate and one tapa dish. I would definitely come back for dinner to try the rest of the menu out.",
            "Really interesting interpretation of a lot of traditional tapas. Go there with an open mind and not expecting a classic tapas meal but be ready to be blown away by a lot of interesting flavours. Favourite was the pluma ibérica",
            "It was nice place having high quality tapas and wine. Only thing you have to know is that this place is very popular so you can have very small space like a sharing table with high chairs. But it's still good to try and have a good time for a wonderful day in SF."

            "Dungeness Crab is a must-order dish. We order both Benedict and omelette and the eggs are prepared just about right. Personally I love omelette better for its soft texture. The French toast is also the best in my recent brunch experiences. Will come back again even though the wait time is almost 90 mins",
            "I know, I know, the line. Always people waiting in a line wrapped around the corner, regardless of time or day. There is often a line already before they even open, so you can't necessarily count on arriving \"early\" and being at the very front.When I wanted to see the hype and joined the rest of the jabronis in the queue, I realized it was ***cash only***. My wife held our spot in line while I walked to an ATM a couple blocks away. When I returned, we had barely moved.The food itself is good, but not great. Having a central location in a tourist neighborhood like North Beach along with the outrageous lines is enough to pique most people's curiosity. Wanna check this place out? Just embrace the suck, but understand there are other breakfast/brunch alternatives nearby that offer similar a quality.",
            "I've been here several times with in a week span. Customer service was great and although there is a wait, it was worth it for me. Very attentive, i did arrive every time about 15-30 min before they open to be seated either the first group of people. I've been there on a weekday and weekend and they always have a line.The chocolate cinnamon toast were delicious and topped with seasonal fruit. Big portion you could have two kids share or if you're really hungry.The eggs Benedict was tasteful and served with their potatoes wedges along with toast. Every bite was delicious and the portion was fairly large. The Monte Cristo was beyond my expectations. It's served with a jelly and it's toasted with ham or turkey inside. With a serving of potatoes! Pretty good highly recommend it.Their service was fast and the coffee is also good. Orange juice was also pretty good. The slice of bread with jelly is good as well.",
            "Came here on a Friday morning after hearing about all the hype. We got here 20 minutes before opening and there was already a line of about 15 parties, which continued to grow as the time grew closer to open. I've never lined up to eat somewhere that hasn't opened yet, so my expectations were sky-high.They have an efficient set-up. Get in a line, order your food, pay at the register, then be seated while the food is served to you. This make for a quick in and out experience, which is good when you're hungry AF. The food was amazing! I'm not a big breakfast person, but I had to admit this place hit the spot. My boyfriend got an omelette and I had the French toast sampler. We both had accompanying mimosas with our food. Everything was great. The portions are also pretty big, which was nice, because I was ravenous. Def worth visiting at least once while in town if you're willing to wait.",
            "My boyfriend and I faced a cold rainy morning to check this place out, and we both are SO glad we did. We arrived at 7:30 to make sure we were the first few in line so we didn't have to wait. I highly suggest this. The line quickly filled up. The restaurant is very small inside and cannot accommodate very many people. This is one of the reasons the wait can be horrid. Anyways, you walk in and order your food first before you are allowed to sit down at a table. I was asked to move because I just sat while my boyfriend ordered. For the food: we picked 3 entrees because we literally couldn't decide. We had the salmon eggs benny, the monte cristo, and the chocolate cinnamon French toast. Good lord, everything was so amazing. My mouth is watering writing this review. The eggs benny were perfectly cooked, and the salmon was fresh and delicious. The monte cristo was a new dish to me. I've never tried it (I apparently live under a rock), but it was seriously life changing. It was the perfect combo of sweet and salty, and the jam that you dip it in is superb. Out of all the dishes, I would suggest ordering this one above anything. The French toast was great as well! I'm not a huge French toast fan, so my review on it may be bias. If you like French toast though, there's was some of the best I've had. We also had mimosas. Nothing special about them, just your typical mimosa, but they do have alcoholic beverages to spice up your breakfast/brunch  All in all, if you are in San Fran and need somewhere to go to breakfast/brunch, this is the place to go!!",
            "If you're planning on having brunch at Mama's on Washington, be prepared to wait in a long line. Twice. The first line wraps around the front of the restaurant and it took us approximately an hour to get inside. Once inside, you do have to wait again for tables to clear and to order your food. The venue itself is very small, so seating is limited which explains the long waits.The menu offers your typical brunch items like omelettes, egg benedicts, pancakes, and French toast. The French Toast Sampler comes with 3 types of delicious types of french toast and generous portions of fresh bananas, blueberries, and strawberries. It's ideal for people craving something sweet for breakfast/brunch. The drink menu is small and some drinks are overpriced. The peach Bellini is $9 and was a very small portion. Do more they do not offer bottomless mimosas, if that's what you're looking for.Other things to keep in mind: they do not take credit cards and parties larger than 5 cannot split checks and are charged 15% gratuity automatically.Overall, the waits are off-putting but the food is very delicious. Definitely coming back to try other items on the menu.",
            "UPDATE 1/16/19:  Another amazing visit to Mama's and once again it did not disappoint! This time I REALLY puffed out; used 3 cheat days and a lot of extra time on the hamster wheel for this one:Northwest Omelette: Smoked Salmon Capers Leaks and a cheese sauce I can't put my finger on - Super tasty. They don't mess around with their smoked Salmon: it is super tasty!French Toast Sampler: Basically gives you a bit of everything on the menu. Carbs for a week but OMG! The taste!I also had a side of bacon, coffee, and fresh squeezed Grapefruit juice - all above reproach!The staff are so friendly and attentive. Though there is a line almost always, I never feel like I need to rush and my coffee cup is never below half full! Half full people! Yeah they don't wait for you to be out of coffee. Novel concept right????I still maintain that I won't wait 2 hours for breakfast anywhere. Heck I won't wait two hours for any place at any time, but that's me - I don't queue well!Howeverrrrr,If I were forced to, I'd be rewarded with the best breakfast I have ever had. I totally get the queue.  The owners keep the size of their restaurant down to what their chefs can manage per sitting so they can focus on sending out the best meal possible. My breakfast was amazing. Everyone's around me - A-MAY-ZINGG.Show up on a weekday about 20 minutes before they open and you should get right in. Forget the weekend, unless standing outside for 2 hours is your thing.",
            "A good friend of mine invited me to get breakfast with her and I couldn't pass this up as everyone in the Bay Area that I knew of had been telling me that I had been missing out, so yeah, I thought I would try it to what the fuzz was all about.First of all, you have to show up EARLY. I was there really early like before 8 and there was a line ALREADY and you couldn't go in until your entire party has arrived. Luckily, my friend got there just in time as we were ushered in. Before we could even sit down, we were told to get in another line to order our breakfasts which we both ended up getting French toasts. It really was a big plate, but I don't see anything THAT special that people would line up for. Also a lot of unnecessary powdered sugar that almost covered everything. The French toasts alone tasted pretty good so I didn't think they had to be covered with so much sugar and chocolate syrup. But at least, I can now say that \" Yeah, I've been there.\"",
            "Very much a tourist trap. Long lines for overpriced and underwhelming food and service. CASH ONLY just to further inconvenience customers.I went for brunch last week with a friend on a weekday, and we still waited nearly an hour. The family ahead of us made the good decision to get focaccia from Liguria Bakery across the street. Meanwhile, we were starved by the time we got inside.The tables were opening up inside, but the hostess still thought to sit two larger people in an odd corner sandwiched by the stairs and a plant. The table is clearly meant for one person, and so we were uncomfortable the entire meal.My friend really wanted a side of pancakes, but without the option anywhere on the menu, he just added eggs and bacon.  I had the corned beef eggs benedict.  We opened with the warm coffee cake, the one menu highlight.The English muffin was soggy, maybe not even toasted at all. Eggs and hash were not memorable at all. Lightly griddled breakfast potatoes, lacking crust. The kitchen forgot my friend's eggs, and he didn't even finish the pancakes.I'd go to the IHOP in Fisherman's Wharf in a heartbeat instead.",
            "First of all, why is the line for this place so longgg?!?! We waited for nearly an hour to get inside. Half hour in I figured hey, since we've already invested that much time, how much longer could it take? Well, that hour long wait was just the beginning. Once inside, expect another line to get to the register. After ordering, you're ushered to a seat  ... then you wait some more. The food was decent, but not out of this world undeniably \"I'm gonna wait for this if it's the last thing I do\" delicious. So with that said, my first visit was enough.",
            "Hm good..but worth the hype...maybe not? Like everyone says, you'll want to get their early to avoid a ridiculous wait..but even then, you're going to have to wait so bring someone you can talk to/catch up with for at least an hour if you want to not be bored out of your mind. Luckily I came with friends I hadn't seen in ages so we had lots to talk about and the 1.5-2 hr wait ended up passing quickly (we got in line at 8:30 am and got seated around 10:20). The wait will also give you time to decide what you want because once you get in the restaurant, they'll have you order and pay and then wait until they can seat you (at least another 15 mins). My party ended up trying:-French toast sampler-Omelette-Silver dollar pancakes-Chocolate french toastWhile the food was good and typical SF prices, I feel like it's not something you HAVE to try while in SF. There's tons of brunch places in SF that don't require this long of a wait so don't feel too pressured to come here.",
            "In my opinion, this place is overrated and I honestly have no idea how their bathroom is not some type of health hazard! To go to the bathroom, you have to walk through the kitchen and go outside to this tiny out house (just one bathroom and it's the smallest bathroom I've ever seen). I understand they're limited on space but having customers walk through the kitchen is so weird to me. They have food sitting out and cooks doing things and I just felt so grossed out that people's hair could easily get into the food on their way to the bathroom.My food was okay at best, I ordered one of their Eggs Benedict and I wasn't a fan. I will never come back. Also, we waited in line for almost 1 hour (we got there super early to beat the crowd but that obviously wasn't the case). I give this place 3 stars instead of 1 because 3 out of 6 friends liked their food (one of them ordered toast a jelly so not sure if that even counts...)",
            "Mamas is killing the breakfast game. We came on such a perfect day: scored a premium parking spot, only 30 minutes in the line, and the food came out in what felt like minutes. The server even let us sit down first, while he walked our order to the counter himself. Amazing job mamas, we'll be back for more!!!",
            "Before you plan on dining here, be aware there is a wait time (as low as 10 minutes, but can be as long as 1hr+). Once you enter, you will wait in another line to order your food and be seated. Once you order your food, you can expect your food within less than 10-15 minutes as they have staff that is highly efficient. The key to this place is their food quality and uniqueness. In other words, the \"french toast\" here is not the french toast you'll get elsewhere. The freshness is inexplicable, rather it must be experienced for yourself. It's​ so delicious that you won't want to add maple syrup! However, you might want to ask for \"mama's special house jam\"! It is by far one​ of the most delicious jams I've ever had! The egg benedict had many spins to it, but we had the vegetarian one. There was avocado, baby spinach, tomato, and most of all a perfectly poached egg with some hollandaise sauce! The mimosas complemented this meal quite well! One thing that was a 4/5, not 5/5 was the Canadian Bacon. It was a little too rubbery than what I was expecting. Come with a large appetite and leave feeling great! The pricing is fair for the quality and location, so be advised it is slightly on the more expensive side! Also,​ parking in the area is a nightmare, as it is located at the corner of Northbeach. So come early and prepared to enjoy grub at this place!",
            "Yo, Mama's is da bomb.....I think I can go on with yo mama puns, but I'm going to focus the rest of  the review on answering the age-old questions of how to get a table at Mama's and whether the wait is worthwhile.Here's an idea of what to expect on a Sunday, based on the timestamps from pictures on my phone:7:40am: Arrival. The good news was that street parking was ample, but the bad news was that there was already a long line forming. 8am: Opening! People start to trickle in slowly. They let groups in at a time, taking into account available seating, and it almost feels like lines at Disneyland.8:20am: Made it into the restaurant. Ogling at the colorful loaves of bread they use for their French toast. We place the order at the counter, and they pointed us to a table.9am: After looking wistfully at several rounds of Benedicts, French toasts, and Monte Cristos fresh off the griddle but making their way towards other tables, I was ecstatic to see our order finally arrive.9:05am: Satisfied with my food pictures from different angles; feast time! I think the highlight was the DUNGENESS CRAB BENEDICT. While most place get away with creamy starchy crab cake or skimpy sad-looking lumps of crab, Mama's is my favorite version in SF because they offer generous portions of fresh crab meat. It sandwiched in bread, spinach, and Insta-perfect poached eggs with a splash of umami hollandaise. The basic Benedict setting accentuates the subtle crab flavors. Just as mama would make this--basic yet scrumptious.A favorite is the FRENCH TOAST SAMPLER, and ours included the blueberry, cranberry-orange, and cinnamon. Don't come expecting something flamboyant like many of the French toast gimmicks of SF; Mama's, as true to its name again, specializes in their variety homemade breads. The take is also a little different than the eggy bread of typical French toast, because it's more like a cakey bread sampler with fruit and a side of syrup. In fact, it's almost like a French toast version of a muffin (especially the blueberry) with a magically fluffy texture. I like how it's predominantly fruity and not too sweet.One of their most popular items is the MONTE CRISTO, a beast of a sandwich enveloping roasted turkey, honey baked ham, cheddar and gruyere, cooked on the griddle to make the bread French-toast-like with a slightly crispy exterior. You can make this sweet or savory, depending on how much of the homemade jam you add. I can just visualize my mom explaining how much of a rip-off it is for them to be charging $15+ on a ham turkey and cheese sandwich... but the bread is at the perfect sweet spot between French toast a toasty sandwich, and the flavors come together so well. Who knew that such sorcery could transform an otherwise mundane sandwich.The servers were so nice (which I guess is also consistent of the Mama's nurturing demeanor) and they gave us this gigantic corner table for 6, even though there were only 2 of us. They didn't ask if we were okay with sharing the table, nor did they reshuffle the seating with others waiting in line outside. I think they really care about making your visit the best dining experience possible (once you make it through the rite of passage in the long lines)Tips:- Cash or debit card only- Starve yourself the night before so you'll have the stomach for a hearty monte cristo early the next morning- They used to only offer monte cristos at 11am, but it is available all day now by popular demand- I would ask for no butter on the French toast, because it has more than enough flavor (and it would last longer in case you need to take this to-go)- There aren't a ton of potatoes, so I wouldn't necessarily count on an entree filling you up if are very hungry (we got 3 entrees for 2, and took home about half the French toast sampler)- Total was $64 pre-tip, which is very reasonable considering the quality, portion sizes, and especially the crab- Fishermans' Wharf is very close by; I highly recommend a walk afterwards. I think mama would tooOverall, I loved the visit to Mama's for its homemade brunch and equally homey charm: the interior is yellow themed, and the tablecloths have prints of lemons and other fruits. They also have neat details like fresh flowers and seasonal decor. Whoever the mama of Mama's is, they are arguably the OG Mama when it comes to brunch.",
            "A little overrated!  Have had this place bookmarked for forever, and finally went on a Tuesday morning. 7:35am, 2nd party in line (they open at 8am, closed on Mondays).  On this particular day, I could have gone 8:30am and still been in the first seating group, so seems that weekdays are the days to come.  Logistically, they allow -9ppl into the restaurant at a time, then you get to wait in line again to order food at the cashier.  After you order, seat yourself and wait for your food and drinks.Food was decent, but nothing amazing or drool-worthy, unfortunately--most definitely not worth any wait.  I would equate the food to any standard diner.  It's nice that the restaurant has been in the same family and around for 50+ years, but for the price point of ~$16/plate, the infamous line, and the stellar reviews, I was expecting much more.  To be fair, I didn't try their most popular dish, the French toast monte cristo (I'm pregnant and not allowed to have cold cuts unless super heated, and the other people in my party didn't want to order that).  I will visit again when I try that, and update this review as necessary.Potatoes - just your standard home potatoes, but they were on the mushy side and were in need of salt/pepper or better flavoring.  Potatoes come with most of the dishes.Homemade corned beef hash ($16.5) - also lacking in seasoning, but good portion size and proportion of meat to potatoes in the hash.Washington Square Omelette and Florentine Benedict were standard, and my dining mates didn't bother to pack leftovers to go.Carrot cake - highlight of the meal!  Cake was very light and moist, with not too many walnuts/raisins.  Icing was super light as well and not overly sweet.  We didn't try any other of their sweet breakfast items, but I think those are the way to go at Mama's.$60/3 people (before tip) including only 1 cup of coffee and 1 slice of carrot cake.  At the price and the flavor of what we got, overall this place is overrated.",
            "My first stop when I arrived to San Francisco due to stellar reviews. I didn't have to wait 2 hours to eat like others, there was only like 3 parties ahead of us. This place is VERY tiny. You have to stand in line to order and then they seat you. The food is good don't get me wrong but the price does not reflect portions. This is literally a place to snack to hold you for like an hour before you're hungry again. The sausage here is very delicious (my favorite part of my meal). The buttermilk pancakes are also very good but for the price it should come with at least a side of potatoes or bacon. This place is a little overrated but at least I can say I tried it and crossed it off my bucket list. Definitely not a place I'd go out of my way for however.",
            "So good! Bread was super light and fluffy. Best Benedict i ever had! They're killin it french toast sampler was so good, made me feel like a kid. The jam at this place!!! Perfect. Went on a weekday so took like 30min to be seated. Some rando guy was reading a book while 10people were waiting to be seated. Its a sunny day and there is a park right outside. Talk about entitled. Other than that this place I'd wait 2hrs to have what i had. We took burgers home they were just ok. Marin Joes in Corte Madera still wins for best burger.",
            "If you're looking for a solid French toast, slice of carrot cake, or seafood benedict, Mama's is a must. I first visited Mama's 3.5 years ago after being urged to visit by a fan, and I remember feeling blown away upon completion of my meal. Last weekend, I managed to trek out to the city for Saturday morning brunch with a friend after failing to return for so long--no regrets there!Once you arrive at Mama's, you'll almost certainly be greeted by a long line. If you're in a small party, the line shouldn't take more than 30~45 minutes. If you get too peckish while waiting there are ample bakeries / cafes nearby, so don't worry about that too much. Once inside, you stand in another line where you're able to see the cooks put their finishing touches on a variety of items that are nearly ready to be served. You'll also catch a glimpse of the phenomenal baked goods that Mama's has to offer--I was extremely tempted to buy one of each, but ultimately stuck with getting a slice of the carrot cake to go. You MUST try the carrot cake, even if you're not a carrot cake fan! It is truly out-of-this-world, and worth carrying around in a box to-go.After standing in this second queue, you're able to order at the register. Some personal favorites of mine include the Crab Cake Benedict, the Norwegian Benedict (made with smoked salmon), and the Cinnamon Chocolate French Toast. You're actually able to order the French toast by the slice, so if you're too torn on what to order, go ahead and do that. Also, I recently tried the Mama's Special Smoothie and WOW it's delicious--just a tad pricey (at over $7). You will be seated at a table once one becomes available, after you order. Because of this, your food comes out rather quickly once you're seated. Can't complain about service either. The waiters and waitresses are extremely friendly. Tipping isn't obligated since you pay before you're seated but I like to carry some cash on me to leave for the servers nonetheless. The reason I'm giving Mama's four stars instead of five is because during my recent visit there was a miscommunication as I ordered (I thought I was able to order a half-order of the Norwegian Benedict but wasn't, and was charged the full price). It wasn't too big a deal--can't complain about extra food--but had I known I'd be paying for 2 whole meals + 1 smoothie + 1 slice of carrot cake I would've reconsidered my order.",
            "Worth the wait.  Food quality was high and the staff was nice."

            "If you're craving a healthy brunch/breakfast place that is also cute and homey, this is it!This place is bustling on a weekday too, but the staff has gotten the workflow down pat. Kudos to efficiency!!! There is limited patio seating outside so you\"ll likely have to wait if that's what you prefer. There is murakami-like wall art as decor - lovely touch!!! We were lucky and got seats right away on a Monday morning. There was a constant flow of customer nonetheless. We tried their famous avacados 3 ways, a savoury chicken crepe and a matcha chia pudding jar. Service was fast, efficient and friendly. The matcha chia was served first before two of our main dish, which was very thoughtful of the staff. This jar exceeded my expectations! I'm surprised this matcha chia trend hasn't caught on yet. The copious amount of fruits also adds different textures and compliments it well. Hoowever, I thought the price was a tad steep!Avacados 3 way is decent. They used different types of bread for each way, I appreciate the variety. I wish the avocado spread was thicker. On the bright side, this dish also comes with a bowl of fruit. I enjoyed the crepe very much. The toppings were generous and the sauce was delicious! Overall, I would definitely come back. I love the amount of fruits that comes with each order. Definitely try the matcha chia jar is this is your first time :)",
            "My mom and I waltzed into Eight AM around ... EIGHT AM ... on a Sunday morning. The host sat us within minutes, even though it appeared to be bustling.As others have mentioned, they give you a LOT of food. I can polish off a plate of breakfast like no other and I actually had trouble getting to the end. Also ordered a matcha latte - well-balanced and delicious.HIGHLY REC in terms of getting your money's worth!",
            "OK little breakfast/brunch spot that might be a little overrated. Don't get me wrong, the food is fine, the service was good, the location is awesome. But overall, it wasn't anything to write home about.We went as a party of four and the thing that I enjoyed the most was the freshness of their fruit bowl (which gives you an idea of how memorable their frittatas, waffles, bagels, and sides are).",
            "This place is so good and they also have decent prices for how much food you get. We were a group of 5, but two of our people were running a little behind so we did wait a while but they did let us sit while it was just 3 of us. We all knew what we wanted so as soon as the other 2 of our group came, the food came out. I ordered the bagel two ways with fruit cup. I got the 1 of strawberries and 6 of peanut butter with bacon and apples. They also give you so much fruit in the cup. This also only costed $13 which is pretty good compared to many other brunch places. My friends also really enjoyed their food. Highly recommend you try this place. Turnover of tables is quick. Quality of food is good. I would come back if I'm in the area.",
            "This is the perfect place for loaded bagel lovers! You can order two different halves and customize it to your liking. Plus the little cafe is so cute. Definitely seemed like a family owned spot. It's the perfect place to get a nice bite before a day of site seeing. Loved this gem!",
            "I have decided that Eight AM is one of the best spots to go for breakfast/brunch after an epic night out.Headed here as a rec from a friend after our New Year's adventures, I came here for brunch and was shocked at the incredible array of my favorite breakfast options. The place is cute, comfy, clean, the line goes by quickly, and the food is delicious. I ordered the 11AM (yes, they have crepes named after times in the day and they go along pretty well with how I feel at each hour interval. In fact, I ordered this at 11:01) and it was so delicious!I wish this place had a wider brunch drink menu, but if you're just looking to catch up with some friends, go out with family, or have some quality brunch, I'd definitely recommend Eight AM!",
            "We where in San Francisco for New Years anddecided to give this place a shot. Me and my family we're  all happy with the results. The service was quick and they all take pride in there job. I ordered the avocado toast and a vanilla late both good.My son said it was best waffle he ever had. They play good low key music good job guys keep up the good work!",
            "Excellent service, great location, and yummy food! We both ordered frittatas and it was a huge meal that my husband and I could have split! The fruit bowl was so delicious and filled with a wide array of fresh fruit, the potatoes were very flavorful and the frittatas were fluffy and yummy!The menu had many unique combinations including the dungey crab frittata which was excellent! Highly recommend this spot!",
            "Went here with a couple of friends and I shared the Banana Nut Waffles and the Avocado Toast 3 Ways!  Portions are big and tasty, classic brunch foods.Service was great and tables had pretty fast turnover.",
            "Wow! What a little jem fresh, reasonable and delicious. Staff is friendly and helpful, selections are just right. This is not Denny's so don't expect a big menu or super large portions. This is quality above quantity. Sit down, relax and enjoy the food. Nice to know this place is here, it will become one of our must stops when in town.",
            "I love this spot! Everything is so fresh and delicious. I orders the toast 3 ways and the diabetic shock on a plate aka banana walnut waffle. I am NOT complaining! The waffle took very good care of my hunger so I am thankful. The toast 3 ways can be made very easily at home which I love! I'm a terrible cook so the fact that I can take home an easy-to-make recipe and it taste edible is wonderful! Score. It's very warm inside so if it's warm outside, I'd stick to sitting outside. Fruit is very fresh. I love that the tomatoes are sometimes green! Beautiful. Service is very quick and friendly. It's a really good breakfast spot. Go here. Oh! The bacon is reeeeeee-dic. Mmmm mmm mmm",
            "Yes. Yes. Yes. What a fantastic little breakfast spot in fisherman's wharf. The menu is extensive and it appears that everything is delicious. I sat outside on a chilly Saturday morning and heard people at tables beside me exclaiming how wonderful their dishes were from the crepes to the avo toast. I ordered the Castro frittata based on recommendations here and I was pleasantly surprised. The sausage was delicious and I appreciated the side of fruit. Seasoned potatoes came with the dish and they were very good as well.There's a little bit of a wait on Saturday mornings but service is quick. I only waited a minute because I was willing to eat outside. Those with larger groups who wanted to eat inside waited maybe 10 minutes around 9am. Not bad.Only negative here is that they don't take American Express. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this spot for a filling and reliable breakfast at a decent price.",
            "Really good food with a great location. Quality food and service was prompt and on top of things. The breakfast was postcard perfect, what you see in the photos is what you get and it's delicious. It's like a secret I wished I could keep but it's in such a crazy touristy spot but with really great food, cost is very reasonable and the service was very excellent. Will return again!",
            "Tried Eight AM for the first time this morning and it was absolutely amazing!! It's a nice little spot with amazing service and food! We tried the avocado toast three ways, so good! Not to mention the great location with a very short walk to the piers. Will definitely come back soon!",
            "We chose Eight AM based on the stellar reviews and we were looking for a place near Ghirardelli Square.The place itself is super casual yet warm and inviting. There's a few tables outside and the majority are inside. There's usually a wait after 9am even on weekdays so add your name to the list as soon as you arrive and hope for the best! We arrived at 9:30 and ended up waiting about 15-20 mins for a table.Most of the menu is traditional brunch fare, but there were a few stand outs I kept seeing like the avocado toast 3 ways so I ended up going with that. Despite being something I could make at home- it was super fresh and the portions were large! I ended up taking half home to snack on later. Service was friendly and they never hesitate to refill drinks! Would easily return!",
            "This place had the best breakfast in the area for sure. We went there before work and it didn't disappoint. There was a very short line, which is usually a good sign. It is a unassuming little breakfast place but clean. The staff was courteous and attentive.I got the French toast with caramelized bananas and caramel sauce and my coworker had the banana waffle. They were absolutely amazing. It wasn't your basic French toast and you could totally tell that they took some extra steps to make it a special experience. It was honestly one of the best breakfast I've had in a long time.My only complaint was the coffee was subpar. And it wasn't cheap either, if I'm going to pay that kind of price for coffee I would expect it to be good. There are so many great coffee shops in the area you would think that they would be able to at least have one of the shops make them their coffee.All I know is I would absolutely come back here again.",
            "The Breakfast here is amazing. Super fresh starting with the fruit to the food and their juices they are all very tasty. Amazing quality food, you wont be disappointed.",
            "I haven't done brunch in a while and this spot popped up on Yelp. My friend and I decided to give it a try! We got to the place around 1130am on a Sunday and there was surprisingly no line! We were seated immediately and the staff was nice and friendly. After looking at the menu, we decided to get avocado toast 3 ways (bacon, egg, tomato toppings), the soy vanilla chia seed pudding, and the bagel plate (one with avocado, ham, and egg, another with peanut butter, apples, and bacon). I really appreciate how all their dishes come with a side of fruit salad, normally we'd be paying extra for this somewhere else. Our food came out pretty quickly. The avocado toasts and the bagels were just okay tbh - they were good, but nothing memorable. The avocado toast with bacon and the peanut butter bagel with bacon and apples were my favorites of the sets. The chia seed pudding was my favorite out of everything we ordered though - everything was layered perfectly! On another note, the bathroom was clean! And their playlist was on point!",
            "Their breakfast menu is very rich.. You find everything what you need to start your day. The staff is very nice and serving happily. This is what you need to see in the eary morning",
            "I went in this morning and had an amazing experience.The food was so so good and everyone was so warm and welcoming. My friend told me it was a \"hole in the wall\" in all the right ways and I couldn't agree more. They make their food with pride and looks Instagram post ready. I wish this shop many successful years! :) I cannot wait to come back."

            "I agree with all the other reviews. This place is great for a seaside meal. Awesome view of the bay, great food and atmosphere. Enjoy!!I started with a local red lager, a favorite. Followed up with six oysters. How the staff keeps up with the oyster orders, I will never know. I was looking at the kale salad but splurged on the squid salad. Very glad I did, the squid was fresh and delicate, not too chewy. Finally, I couldn't pass up on the rustic seafood soup. It was so good, I wiped the bowl with bread. (So wrong but so necessary)Enjoy and I will return.",
            "Line was short for a change despite the great weather. Service by Laura was terrific. Oysters were fresh and briny. Seafood Stew was hot and flavorful, the seafood cooked masterfully. Prices are not inexpensive but you do get what you pay for. Here's my whine. Just add some dungeness crab to the Seafood Stew and call it Ciopinno! And would it be too much trouble to clean the poop chute from the prawns for the stew while you're at it?",
            "Definitely one time thing for me. This seems to be a touristy thing that most locals are willing to do. Came around 5:30 and there was short line outside - yes, it moves pretty quickly. Ordered a few things to try and bill ended up being around $94 without tax. Ordered mixed oyster platter, grilled oysters, bay fries, and seafood stew. First, oysters are tiny. It comes in this huge platter and for $40, oysters are SMALL. Not really worth it. Grilled oysters also came at a steep price. $16 for 4. These were bigger, but it wasn't until I overheard another table ordering that I knew you could MIX & MATCH the grilled oysters. Well okay, thanks for telling us, waiter. 4 stars really is for the freshness of the seafood and the seafood stew itself. Favorite and most worth it dish for $24 in my opinion. Plenty of seafood, flavorful broth, super delicious and probably often overlooked by the oysters everyone comes for. Service wasn't super attentive either, as one waiter oversees all the outdoor area. Entire restaurant isn't terribly big, space could probably be optimized more.",
            "If you time your visit right, you might just get a quick easy walk-in. The lunch queue, as always, was dreadful and long. Have your phone handy or simply enjoy the scenery and the blue sky while you wait. To be seated, your entire party must be present when called.Grilled Oysters: The pearly goodness were smothered in this fantastic house garlic sauce. The whole thing was gone in seconds. If you're an oyster connoisseur, then go with both raw and grilled!Cod Sliders: Fish & chip style batter-fried cod squares layered with slaw and sandwiched in buns. Well seasoned but a bit messy to eat thanks to the wetness of the slaw. Nicely seasoned and easy to share.Fried Ling Cod Collar: Favorite of the day! Nice and tender on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Lightly dusted and fried to perfection. It was sooo good to the point that our friend ended up picking up the whole thing and nibbled on it Flintstone-style.Clam Steamer: Fresh and juicy. The obvious pick for every visit. But wait for it.... ALWAYS get that extra order of bread to dunk them in the ol' mighty clam juice - the perfect concoction of the land (sausage bites) and sea.Hands down the go to place for seafood whenever we have guests in town!",
            "Came here during my San Francisco trip because I heard lists about it. The restaurant is known for super fresh oysters and seafood since it comes straight from the Hog Island Oyster farm nearby. So the oysters they serve were harvested just hours before.I went on a Friday night, the line was kind of long but the turnover was super fast so don't let the lines deter you. The menu is pretty straight forward with a nice wine and cocktail program.On this particular night I went for the grilled oysters and some old bay fries. I couldn't decide which flavor grilled oysters I wanted (bourbon chipotle, roasted jalapeño or green garlic) so the waitress recommended the bourbon chipotle since it was their most popular one. It did not disappoint; rich grilled oysters topped with brown sugar, bourbon, chipotle and butter. Sweet, smoky and satisfying. The old bay fries were just okay for what they are. They also serve complementary bread and butter which I used to soak up the leftover bourbon chipotle juices from the grilled oysters. I'm not a huge fan of oysters but this place is a must try.",
            "Absolutely LOVED the oysters here. Honestly, I didn't mind the price because they have quality oysters! Our server had helpful recommendations and we loved everything she recommended to us after listening to our preferences. When we told her we prefer oysters on the sweeter side, she recommended three: Hog Island Sweetwater, Glacier Point, and Divine Pine. We chose these three and had the Oyster Bar mix for $40 (1 dozen). We loved all but especially enjoyed Hog Island Sweetwater and Glacier Point, that we made an additional order afterwards. Her local beer and wine recommendations were on the point, too. We only had oysters, fries, beer and wine here...but honestly it may have been my best meal during my short stay in SF!",
            "There are already 5000+ reviews. So what else do you wanna know? We were visiting San Francisco again and came back here again. Definitely we had a good time last time.  This is a really vibrant and spirited (literally) restaurant in San Francisco. The surrounding area near the waterfront is really nice.I always have an affinity for oysters and don't remember how I got it started. We ordered 2 dozen oysters -- assorted. They looked very very fresh and inviting. We just couldn't wait to consume them. Nicely chilled, they tasted amazingly good. The size of the oysters was not big. But each one tasted fresh, smooth, and mushy.The clam chowder was great. The small clams in the shell were fresh and yummy. The broth was rich and creamy. Yummy! We also ordered mussels in pesto broth. It was equally rich and creamy. We asked for enough bread to soak up all the remaining broth. Nothing wasted!The kale salad was great - the right amount of sweetness and sourness. I especially liked the fresh apple cubes and toasted nuts. Very refreshing indeed.Great food, great atmosphere, great service.",
            "I went here to get my Dungeness crab fix but had just missed the crab boat-they sold out of crabs by 1pm! :(. But I was satisfied by their yummy grilled oysters and clam chowder.  The clam chowder had a watery consistency and I do prefer a thicker chowder but I loved the mound of clams still in shells they put in the bowl and the rustic touch of potatoes and herbs.  The grilled oysters come 4 per order and I could have easily eaten 10 orders!  So delicious!!  The service was superb; everyone was so nice and attentive.  I loved sitting at the counter to watch all the grilling and food prep action.  Hog Island does seafood and service right!",
            "Surprisingly great seafood. With its location, this could just be a tourist trap, but the food was legit. Wait was only about 15 minutes on a Monday, however it probably gets quite busy on the weekend. The raw oysters were some of the best I've had in the West Coast. The sampler had an awesome assortment  of flavors and sizes. The oysters were perfectly shucked and ridiculously fresh tasting. Even the tiny oysters packed quite a punch.  I also really enjoyed their mussels with pesto cream sauce and a side of fries. The fries were perfectly crispy and very flavorful and the mussels were delicious and once again, super fresh tasting. The cream sauce was quite good and a nice change of pace from more typical flavors used with shellfish. Plenty of bread was ordered to consume it all up. Nice view, convenient location, great food. The only knock against it is that it is a bit on the pricey side, but food was good enough to feel the experience overall was worth the premium.",
            "Great place, great food, great service.For the 2 of us, we ordered a dozen of mixed oysters, chowder, gumbo, and bay fries. That was way more than enough food and we couldn't even finish everything.Oysters (mixed) - We had a variety of small and big oysters and they all tasted delicious. All the oysters were clean, and sooo sweet. It's a MUST to get their oysters!Chowder - The chowder was very interesting. The consistency was very watery, yet still flavorful. The best thing about it was that they don't skimp on clams. The clams took up almost all of the bowl and I didn't even have space to put all the shells. I'd recommend this too even though it's not like other clam chowders.Gumbo - Watery consistency as well, but an abundance of meat and seafood. There was chicken, sausages, clams, shrimp - literally so much protein! This was okay and I probably wouldn't get it again since it didn't stand out like the other food.Old bay fries - DELICIOUS. Crispy, perfect thickness, and goes very well with the chowder. A great appetizer to share!All in all, a lovely place for lunch especially if you want some damn good oysters and chowder.",
            "This is where you go when you want to low key impress someone. It's a little pricey but it includes a great view of the Bay Bridge and waterfront. If you're a people watcher, like me, the ferry practically docks in front of this restaurant. Let's get to the nitty gritty. The food here is amaz-za-zing! I'm not big on shellfish, but dammit, you wouldn't guess that by the way I was eating. The oysters are fresh, beautiful, and delicious! We got the Oyster Bar Mix and the Chipotle Bourbon and Spring Garlic Butter Grilled Oysters. Our individual orders included a mussel dish, the cod, clam chowder, and the grilled cheese. Everything was so yummy!A must have is the clam chowder and grilled cheese sandwich. Take your sandwich and dunk that puppy in the chowder. Just do it! Results? Instant yummy face.There may be a line of people waiting to get in, it's not a huge place, but try to wait it out. The people who work her seem genuinely happy and totally knowledgeable when it comes to drinks and what you order. I, personally, didn't know that oysters came in all shapes and sizes and location acquired plays a part in how they look and taste.If you're near the ferry building, this is definitely a place to visit.",
            "The Hog Island hype is real.Some friends and I came by on a Friday for lunch. I got in line around 12:15pm, and it took about 20 minutes to get seated. Once we did, the complimentary fresh Acme bread and butter was an amazing start--our server was kind enough to entertain our 4+ requests for more bread. I opted for the $14 CLAM CHOWDER with manila clams, aromatic vegetables, bacon, potatoes, and cream. The soup isn't thick or viscous in texture, but the flavor is on point, and it is loaded with seafood. And dipping the free bread in the chowder is filling AND affordable.My friends got some oysters (I forget which) and the $16 MUSSELS steamed in a broth with white onion, garlic, mustard, ginger, and white wine + $3 FRIES. I can't recall what the broth was like, but those thin crispy fries are dope.It took me years to finally try this place, and boy am I glad I did. I probably wouldn't come here on the weekends when it's packed, but it's worth it during the week.",
            "So, let's start with the star of the show: The Oysters!  This menu featured a selection that spanned the entire country.  Washington, California, Massachusetts, New York and the Carolinas were all represented.  The oysters were fresh, well-shucked and presented on a bed of ice with lemon and mignonette.  We asked for cocktail sauce and grated horseradish which was happily supplied.  They unfortunately did not have oyster crackers which was a bit off for a place with 'oyster' in its title and my partner-in-crime is one of those people who actually puts crackers on her oysters. Every oyster was ice cold, super fresh and delicious.  But on to the experience overall....We showed to a line that was probably 50 deep and not really moving.  It took us a about 30-40 minutes to get to the door.  We didn't learn until about 25 minutes in that you're allowed to drink cocktails in line which would have made this wait go by much faster.   The view of the water and people watching on the board walk would actually be something I might look forward to next time with a beer or a cocktail.  We were eventually seated at the bar that faces the open kitchen. There's a crew of 4-5 cooks, working at breakneck speed and with all the precision on a finely engineered machine. She ordered a glass of sparkling Rosé and I ordered \"The Yellow Submarine\", which was a citrus gin cocktail with some serious horsepower.  This is the kind of drink you have one of, tip your hat and switch to beer after.  There were 9 varieties of oysters and we ordered 2 of each.  We also ordered fried Cod collar.  The drinks and oysters came pretty quickly considering the place was PACKED.  As we got about halfway through our oysters, I was over the drink and asked for a glass of Prosecco to wash the oysters down with.  We waited about 15 minutes more and asked if there was anything else coming out for us. The waitress said no, that we had only ordered the oysters....meaning she forgot half of our original order as well as the second drink. We just played it off and asked for the check but were a bit disappointed we didn't get to try to cod collar.  Overall, I'd go back again but probably only if it wasn't as packed. My simple take is that if you're willing to sacrifice quality of service at the detriment of customer experience to pack in a few more heads, and people are willing to put up with it, more power to you.  I just won't put it at the top of MY list because I cherish my power as a consumer and spend my dollars where I FEEL they're most appreciated.Food: 9/10Drink: 8/10Service: 6/10",
            "I had to try this place because of all the raving reviews and it did not disappoint! I will say it's obviously on the expensive side because it's seafood. I ordered the chipotle bourbon oysters which were amazing! It was flavorful and I'm honestly not the biggest oyster fan but these were delicious. It was a bit sweet, but not in a bad way. I also got the old bay fries and wasn't very impressed - but they were fine. The Brussels Sprouts salad was perfect! If you know me, you know I love Brussels sprouts. They cut the Brussels into smaller pieces with avocado on top. Loved it!A must go to if you're in the area for sure.",
            "Came here for a quick midday bite and ordered 12 oysters of mixed variety (oyster bar mix), Old Bay fries, a beer, and a cocktail. Worth. The. Price! All the oysters were fresh and delicious--seriously some of the best I've ever had. Old Bay fries were classic and tasty, and I would definitely order them again. The line was long to get seated, but went by pretty fast. Service was quick and organized, and although the seating was a bit crammed, the ocean air and the view of the Bay made up for it.",
            "*4.5 stars*Came here for dinner with a friend -- I've wanted to come here so many times, but the line was always crazy. We had gotten coffee around 3, and decided we were hungry enough around 5:30 to get dinner. There was already a sizable line at hog island but the server told us we would be seated very quickly, and he was right -- it only took about 10 minutes with 5 parties ahead of us.We ordered the clam chowder, the roasted pepper grilled oysters, and the steamers (with pasta). First and foremost, the grilled oysters were incredible.  The clam chowder was amazing as well -- it's topped with a TON of clams and is pretty light overall. The steamers were pretty good as well, an interesting seafood-sausage combo. While the flavors of everything was great, I did end up getting quite a few clams with sand, which dampened the experience a bit.",
            "D E L I C I O U S. The oysters are top-notch.I haven't had anything on the menu I haven't loved.My favorites: -Grilled Squid SaladIt is so good.. It's smoky, flavorful, just the right amount. I get this every single time it's available.-The Chipotle Bourbon Oysters-ChowderThose 3 + fresh oysters is my usual order when we go. This past Christmas, we wrote letters to Santa with my 4 year old daughter. While she asked for slime and a kitchen set, and my boyfriend asked for an espresso machine, I asked for a visit to Hog Island for some oysters. True story.Depending on what time you go (it's not too predictable), there can be quite the line, but they move through it pretty quickly. I think the most I've waited in line was 30 minutes, and we were not even in the roped area yet. The bartenders are really nice if you want to grab a drink while you wait in line, and the service is usually pretty good. Always friendly that's for sure. It can take them a while to tend to your table, but it's just because they're busy. For the amount of volume they get, I think they do a pretty good job.",
            "My FAVORITE CLAM CHOWDER & BLOODY MARY IN SF HANDS DOWN!LOCATION:Yes its a tourist attraction, located in the very busy Ferry Building. WAIT: expect a long wait on weekends, especially on a nice day. The staff will often take drink orders from the line to make it a more enjoyable wait!**BLOODY MARY (must order): must order this! Spicy and delicious but still strong with all the fixins. I was blownn awayy! Drinking it in line, I remember it is going to be worth the wait**CLAM CHOWDER (must order): I have had my share of clam chowders.. but nothing like this one. Light but still creamy, buttery broth, loaded with clams. I have never had a clam chowder as decadent yet simple as this. Do not miss out on this!GRILLED CHEESE: a great pair with the clam chowder! The famous Cowgirl Creamery cheese is used in this grilled perfection- also up there with the best grilled cheese I have had too!OYSTERS: cant go wrong with Oysters. They have lots of selection that varies depending on season and availability.. top them with lots of lemon and just a tiny drop of cocktail sauce, mignonette and tabasco sauce (available upon request)- also just simpler is good too with these tasty refreshing oysters!some of my favs are: *KUMAMOTOS: Small and sweet, just how I love my oysters. These will always be one of my favs.*SWEET WATER OYSTER: These pacific oysters are small and sweet but this trade name Sweet Water is specific to Pacific Oysters that are hand raised by hog island oyster company themselves! If you like Fanny Bay Oysters (also Pacific Oysters) or Kumamotos, you will love these!If they have any MALPEQUES or any type of BLUEPOINTS from the Atlantic coast, those are yummy too!Definitely worth going to or bringing a visitor too! Dont give them that crumby boudin chowder (though still a cool spot for a tourist to visit)- bring them to Hog Island for the authentic SF eats, fantastic market and a beautiful ocean view while you eat if you're lucky (and good weather).",
            "The oyster selection is second to none. They have a wide variety of fresh oysters from around the United States including oysters from Maine which are meaty and rich. Having been to Maine it was nice being able to get some fresh east coast oysters. From briny to mild, from large to small, they meet the need. The oysters are about $3.50 each so I think it's best to get an oyster from the larger variety. In my mind the best oyster here is the Quivet Neck Atlantic Maine oyster. It is meaty and tasty and not overly briny. Even the fresh rolls with butter here are delicious. My rating is solely based on the oysters here but then again why else would you come to an oyster bar?",
            "Fresh seafood. Oysters are the star, but on the pricey end. They were out of their hog island oysters which are typically my favorite here (creamy). Tried their Kumamoto which were fresh, but lacked too much flavor. Mussels were well made and broth was delicious.Pro tip: unlimited delicious bread to soak up all the broth!"

            "New place soft opening. Service is very nice and decor is pretty simple and cozy. The meats are pretty good but needs more flavor. A bit bland for our taste. This place has potential and definitely needs some work (meats and veggies need more seasoning and more sake options). Overall a nice experience.",
            "My family and I used to go to Sushi Hunter before they rebranded the place and now it's an Izakaya restaurant.  We were sad to see the sushi restaurant go but we're ecstatic about the change of direction!The kids love the skewers - chicken wings, chicken heart, wagyu beef...The potstickers were a huge hit as well.I loved the Japanese beer on tap.Had a great time during their soft opening, and we'll be sure to make this a regular dinner spot in the future!",
            "OMG.  They really put alot of love into everything they do here.  Let's start with the food, then decor, then service.  The spinach with black sesame, artistic as well as tasty.  Ok-if you have a heavier palate you can add sauce to it or the condiments.  You got to like black sesame or spinach.   The izakaya: pork belly, bacon wrapped mochi, gizzards, and chicken. All so tasty and tender and grilled on charcoal to perfection.  Sashimi-oh my. Just thinking about it makes me drool.  See my picture because it is so artistically done.  Their sashimi comes from new Zealand, and other places.  The broth of the ramen is so rich and good that I actually drank the whole thing.  That bowl size is just right.  The tofu with bonito flakes, tiny batter goes a long way.  Excellent execution. The dessert was a matcha (green tea) creme brulee with actual vanilla beans. This is legit. Caramelized top is not too thick, just thin enough.  Drinks-full bar, cute bartender.  Cold sake, beer, wine, etc.  Decoration with one Big wood cut into slabs, qbeautiful calligraphy, Japanese menu dishes and japanese lanterns with soft lighting.  Excellent service, so accommodating.   I feel sorry for the dish washer-so many dishes to wash. I love their japanese dishes.  Green tea was hot and with actual taste.  Check out their restroom with interesting decor color.  Parking is tight but if you hover around 6 pm, you get free meter parking.  Who cares, since you have uber or left.  Give me a like on my pics.",
            "So glad an izakaya restaurant is in the neighborhood now!  Tried a ton of the skewers and really loved the pork belly, shrimp, wagyu, and a bunch of the chicken.  The rice balls, gyoza, and eryngii tempura are great too. Definitely a great place for a post work snack/meal with a bottle of sake. Highly recommend!!!",
            "So this newly opened place on the corner of Powell and Union opened up not too long ago (few weeks probably). I have already been a few times and will definitely continue going back. They have an amazing selection of sake and tons of different skewers and appetizers. The staff is also a great help with figuring out what to order! We had the gyoza, which was amazing and the karaage which was WOW. The food quality is great and i'm sure that it will be even better over time! We also had ordered some skewers that were recommended to us and all were so so good. My favorite being the bacon wrapped mochi cake. Overall, this is a really great Japanese feeley place is you're looking for something more authentic. The inside is beautiful with lanterns and a wooden bar! This will definitely be a regular place for me and my friends, definitely a good place to come in on a friday or saturday night and have some drinks!! Excited to see where this place goes in the future!"

(We came here for dinner and didn't try the dim sum.)We had:Sizzling Fish - my favorite!Seafood Clay PotSingaporean NoodlesSzechuan Fish Boiled in Chili? (Forgot) - super good! String Beans & Eggplant Stir fryThere was a waitlist and a short wait (about 20 minutes) but it was also Saturday night prime dinner time.As soon as we were seated, we were attended to and we had a great experience. Food came quickly and servers were attentive. We were all offered complimentary dessert for my mom's birthday as soon as manager heard, which was a very nice gesture. My family all agreed we would come again.",
            "We had dinner here recently and ordered:Steamed Shanghai dumplingSteamed shrimp dumplingCrispy green onion pancakeSzechuan chicken with riceThe reason I wanted to check this place out is because it's the only restaurant in the area that looked clean in the photos and they also take reservations. For both of these conditions, they did not disappoint. We were seated immediately when we arrived and the restaurant was pretty clean. Not that I have anything against hole in the wall dimsum shacks, but sometimes you just want to sit down and enjoy a good dinner.The dumplings are good, but not great. I've had better soup dumplings in the past for cheaper. Even the shrimp dumplings were more dumpling, less shrimp. I liked the pancake and the chicken (which has 3 chilli signs on the menu, but is not at all spicy). The chicken comes with rice and we ordered an extra rice, but the waiter forgot to bring it with our order and by the time we got his attention we had already eaten quite a bit of the chicken and didn't need the extra rice. Basically service is not good and the restaurant is pretty loud. They have a decent wine selection and their beers on draft are quite fresh.I probably wouldn't go back unless I wanted to eat dumplings and absolutely didn't want to wait in line.",
            "This is one of the few places that sells Dim Sum late in the evening, so I decided to come here. I ordered the sweet and spicy chicken wings, steamed shrimp dumplings (har gow), steamed pork and shrimp dumplings (siu mai), baked bbq pork buns, and a combination house fried rice. The dimsum was alright, nothing special about it. The chicken wings were pretty good, along with the fried rice. Minus stars for service! The service was terrible. First of all, it took 15 minutes to even get one of the server's attention because they legitimately JUST WALK BY YOU AND IGNORE YOU. I came here hungry af and the service literally ruined my appetite. Also, the waitress just tossed our order onto the table and walked away hella fast.",
            "Spicy chili shimp: solidShrimp dumplings: solidRestrooms: not so buenoService: even less buenoI came here with group of 6 people during the week and we had a reservation though when we entered there was only one other table in the place. We sat for a really long time, all 6 of us trying to make eye contact with a server who seemed to be diligent and dedicated to ignoring us. It was... odd. Once we did get someone over to take our order, the food - all of it -, enough for 6 people, came out in less than 10 minutes. It was like the food was already there waiting for us even though our servers weren't really even waiting on us. I got up to use the upstairs restroom, which an employee had just exited from, and when I went in it was more than kind of a mess inside and also the door had no lock. So I walked out and found that they have restrooms in the basement also that are a bit cleaner and have functioning doors/locks. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but it's otherwise a nice space and great that'll they'll take group reservations online... even if they aren't too keen on serving them.",
            "Walked around Chinatown and picked a dim sum restaurant based on Yelp reviews. It was a bit late and somewhat empty, possibly due to the cold and rainy weather.We had a couple dim sum newbies at the table as well as a few veterans, so we let everyone pick two dishes and we shared everything. The food was fantastic! This was the best dim sum I've had in the States... better than anything I've had in New York or Chicago or Detroit. It was on par with the best I've had in Hong Kong. My favorites were the peking duck, siu mai, gai lan, and steamed pork buns.  I thought the braised beef ribs and the tiger prawns were good-not-great. But other people at my table picked those as their favorites, so it's just a matter of taste to some extent.The service was good and I thought the prices were quite reasonable for the quality of the food and the experience.I did kind of wish for the rotating table top you see at some dim sum restaurants - it was kind of hard to pass 10 dishes around a large round table. But that's a small complaint for an excellent meal, and I would definitely return to Begoni Bistro the next time I'm in San Francisco for work.",
            "Being Chinese and having had dim sum many times, I should have known better but I let my coworkers pick the food and I did not count up the plates and food we were going to get. There were tons of food and I meant plates that HAD TO BE LEFT OFF at the bar area near where we were sitting because we ordered too much....This review is mainly for the staff that helped us shuffle and pack up the plates of food that we ordered. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and it has been 2 days later...still eating the leftovers at work as a team. Go team!+1 for the remodeled restaurant+2 for the food+3 for the staff in handling the madness and bundling up the food",
            "A-OK Chinese restaurant.  Came by with my bf for a dunch on a rainy day.  We had the bbq pork buns, steamed rice in leaves, sweet and sour pork, beef and broccoli, some beef noodle soup, and I think one other dumpling I can't recall.  He had a couple beers, we split a hot sake, and I had a glass of pinot grigio.  Service is quick and pretty friendly, and the food is hit and miss.  The noodle soup was very bland and the beef in the beef and broccoli was very rubbery.  The other items, however, were pretty good, so all around it ended up being a decent Chinese meal.  I like that they have a bar and that they serve a lot of varieties of wine, which makes it stand out from other Chinese restaurants.",
            "UNDERWHELMING.. OPEN LATE & CUTE PLACE THOUGH!EXTENDED HOURS: Looking for a dim sum place at 4pm on a Sunday can be challenging. Some places are closed after morning/afternoon service and closed for rest of the day and some are closed until they reopen for lunch. Luckily Begoni Bistro has continued service and open until 9:30pm daily!ATMOSPHERE: I like that this place is nicer than most dim sum places. It has a more modern look with wooden tables and chairs and a matching bar. EGG BUN: i love my sweet bun.. mmm.. but I felt these buns were too sugary (can feel it crunch in my mouth), too sweet and even a little oil in the center that kind of turned me off :(SHANGHAI DUMPLINGS: These came out luke warm :(SHRIMP & PORK SIU MAI: This was probably my fav of the day. I loSTICKY RICE LOTUS WRAP: I was too full to eat it but I was told it was better than most places.",
            "What a pleasant surprise.   I am a honest food snob.  I want authentic Chinese food whiteout the added \"shi shi price\". When I first saw this place, I had the stereotype kick in.  It's too clean and western decor looking to have authentic Chinese food and it will probably cost an arm and legWell I was pleasant surprised.  We went for dim sum today for lunch and it was GOOD.  a little pricier than the typica Chinese dim sum place but worth it.  I think it will become our new go to dim sum place.  I love the decor, very modern and clean. Food was authentic and good- baker pork bun.  Love love.  We used to alway go to lai Hong for the this. Now we don't have trek there and wait forever.  This place baked pork bun is awesome. - won ton soup - shrimp wontons with tender greens.  Solid!- Westlake soup. Just okay.  I had better elsewhere- half duck - yum- pork and shrimp shui Mai.  Yum- salt and pepper fish fillet.  My daughter loved it.  She ate more than half of the dish - Shanghainese dumplings.  Just ok.  Bund Restaurant is Better- steam chicken feet in black bean sauce.  Yum- pea shoot sprouts.  YumWe will be back. I am hungry just thinking about it.  I was so happy with the food, I forgot to take photos until we already ate half the dish. ;-)",
            "I love coming here on the weekends when I'm craving some Har Gow and Chicken Feet. Begoni Bistro is one of the places in Chinatown that serves superb food, has spectacular service (rare for a Chinese restaurant), and doesn't have excoriating wait times like Hong Kong Lounge or Dragon Beaux. I love taking my mom here when she visits SF since she absolutely loves dim sum but doesn't believe in waiting in line for so long for food. This place is a win win for everyone. Noteworthy items are is the Baked BBQ Pork Buns, Har Gow, Shu Mai, Chicken Feet, and the Porridge (great for when you're hungover). Basically anything you order here will be solid. The food also comes out quick and the staff is really attentive. They also have a decent selection of beer on tap, which is quite impressive. Hair of the dog right? Begoni Bistro is a great alternative if you're in a rush to eat and don't want to wait over an hour to get seated. The last 3 times I came here, I got seated in less than 10 minutes. Nothing to complain about!",
            "I was tempted to give 4 stars based on some choice dishes, but with service considered this was a 3-star dim sum experience for me. When it takes forever to get noticed, then longer to order only to have your food come out lightning fast after that, it raises some red flags. I agree with my table mate that the highlight of this meal was the dumplings. They made for some fluffy little treats. I was also a fan of the pork wontons, which were your traditional fried goodness that I proceeded to bathe in soy sauce. Other than that, the pork buns, fatty Peking duck and non-spicy spicy shrimp were all unimpressive. If you're unfamiliar with eating in Chinatown, this is a spacious place and a good introductory meal. Otherwise, I've been wowed more by some of their neighboring restaurants.",
            "Came into Begoni's for what can be said to be one of the busiest time of the year, San Francisco's lunar new year parade. Wait was about 5minutes, not too bad.The green onion pancake was crispy but didn't have a strong flavor to it.Shrimp rice noodle had a good portion size. I was surprised that it was one shrimp per bite, most places don't give that much shrimp and sizes were big as well.Spinach dumpling is stuffed with mushrooms which had a subtle taste, good alternative for vegetarians or a lighter dim sum.Shrimp har gow was nothing really special, texture was a little mushy.Shanghai dumpling had subtle ginger taste. Pork and shrimp sui Mai are flavorful and meaty.Food was good, for a busy day service was alright but were pretty much nonexistent until I had to wave them down to pay and even then my check and card sat at the counter with no on realizing who's check it was. Tables, restaurant and restroom were pretty clean.Tip for those coming in: look at the menu in advance so you can get helped with your order right away.",
            "Everything was good, but there was nothing outstanding.  I'd still come back here though.  They have a wine bar at the restaurant and that's always a plus!  I don't recommend getting the tiger prawns w/ garlic noodles.  Tiger prawns tempura was good, but were fried with the shells on.  The garlic noodles had no taste, so we mixed with the black bean sauce to make it tasty!",
            "Begoni Bistro is good, one of the better overall values in Chinatown dim sum and authentic enough to satisfy natives. Ingredients are fresh. Service is prompt and efficient. The menu offers a long list of options.So we're squarely in solid \"can't complain\" territory, and I will probably corral some co-workers for a business lunch here some time soon if only to enhance variety while not succumbing to the financial burden of a visit to R&G or City View. Begoni is straight-ahead, no-nonsense, easy crowd-pleasing fare, in portions that satisfy. They also appear to have more than a passing interest in connecting patrons with quality wines, at an attractive bar, and the scene overall makes me curious about trying it out for happy hour.Why one step off perfection? Two things. One, the food lacks a certain Wow factor. It's fine but not really memorable or destination fare. Two, I have to admit I'm not generally over the moon for dim sum. It's often greasy, and sugary, and leaves me feeling bloaty and a little gross in addition to satiated, and these guys are no exception.But it has its moments, and I'd say the chang fen was somewhat of a revelation, and if you have a dim sum itch these guys will scratch it for not too much money, and on that alone they're already ahead of their Chinatown competition.",
            "Personally, nothing had flavor. Everything we ordered just tasted like oil. We had vegetarian chow mein, pork fried rice, beef and broccoli, general chicken, walnut prawns, and hot and sour soup- and it all was just bland. Maybe the kitchen had an off night. Thought this place was going to be a slam dunk.",
            "A group of us (three) was in the mood for a Chinese feast one night and decided to give Begoni a try.  We had the BBQ pork bun, pork potstickers, honey garlic spare ribs, half duck and pork fried rice to share. I had the sweet and sour fish as my entree. It was WAY TOO MUCH food and we had lots of leftovers for the next day. Overall, this is good Americanized Chinese food and it's not greasy. The pork fried rice and the spare ribs were the best dishes of the night for me. The BBQ steamed buns had a good ratio of bun to filling.  Service was better than what you'd expect at a typical ethnic place.  The restaurant itself was well lit and somewhat modern.  With tax and tip, this was about $50 per person.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back here again the next time I'm in the area.",
            "My first visit to Chinatown in San Fran and it brought me here.  Based off of this place, Chinatown in Chicago needs to step it's game up.We had the shrimp and pork shumai, came out hot and fresh but took a little longer than our other dishes.  The bbq pork bun was filled with sweet pork goodness.  We ordered the combo chow mein which was also excellent.  The only thing I was a little disappointed in was our pork soup dumplings.  Only one of the dumplings still had the soup in it but the flavor of the pork made up for the fact there was no broth inside.Overall a great place with prompt service.",
            "Food wasn't that good.  The service was slow and the 2 things that we ordered were  incorrect.",
            "Working deep in FiDi has been a trek and a headache for my commute but I have finally found the silver lining. My office is close enough to Chinatown that lunch options can be expanded to beyond $15 sandwiches and salads.My coworkers suggested dim sum one day and I was super excited. After a short walk, we found ourselves at Begoni Bistro. Even though it was prime lunch hour, we only had to wait 5 minutes.We ordered a ton of dim sum and noodle dishes from the menu and they began to appear at our table almost right away. Everyone agreed that the baos (Cha Siu variety and Egg Yolk one) were fluffy and excellent. I am a big fan of black bean spareribs and found it to be one of the better ones I've had.It was awesome to be there with a group, which allowed us all to try so many different items. We ended up over-ordering so much that we could have had another dim sum meal for the group the next day. The total came out to $22 per person and we were much more satisfied than we would've been had we spent the same amount of money at a standard lunch spot.",
            "As a native Hong Kong-ian (is this even a word), I was a bit hesitant to try this place for dim sum. Afterall, the restaurant name wasn't chinese, it didn't have Cantonese pronunciation, and \"bistro\" isn't what you think of when you think of Cantonese food or dim sum.But, San Fransisco traffic was a mess, and it took a mean 1.5 hours to navigate through the city. By the time we arrived into Chinatown, most dim sum had already wrapped up in the area. Dim sum served until nearly 3pm, and it is all made fresh to order. No push carts, no elderly ladies screaming what they have available in their carts, no aggressive patrons trying to budge their way in to get the freshest shrimp dumplings.We ordered a plethora of vegetarian and meat dishes, and also the beef chow fun. Because it's made to order, and because there are other customers, the food doesn't all come out at once. A plate comes out here and there, and everything is pipping hot.Honestly... this is the first comparable dim sum to that of Hong Kong. After living in NYC and going to most well know dim sum in that area, I think it's safe to say that SF dim sum has put it to shaaaaaaame.Huge pieces of shrimp in their shrimp dumplings, amazing flavors, with not so much oil in their chow fun, fresh and crisp chinese broccoli and pea shoots, and hot and flavorful teas, to compliment the experience. Best part? Their house chili oil, that is in every table, is actually spicy. Tip: try it on the shumai. Try it dipped with chicken feet. Heck, try it on everything."

            "It's a grab-and-go, hole-in-the-wall dim sum spot. We walked over here around 1030a one weekend and there was only a small line. The line moved quickly. We ordered shui mai, hai krow, footballs and steamed pork buns for 2 people. A single order of dim sum typically includes 3 pieces. One of the exceptions was the pork buns, where it's a bun per order. All of the food items came out to be a couple of cents over $10 (so cheap!). We were stuffed and had leftovers after our meal The dim sum were so good that we didn't miss the lack of soy sauce and satay; they were flavorful by themselves. Still dreaming about that meal. I would 10/10 recommend checking this spot out for an on-the-go meal.",
            "came here bc its rated 2nd best egg tart place in SF's chinatown! when i arrived in late afternoon, suffice to say no piping hot egg tarts were available anymore, but a line still extended far out the door for the baked delights.despite the bustling busyness, customer service was nice and i got my order (3 pineapple buns and 2 melon cakes) in a jiffy. $4 for these baked goods! they take card but cash is easier and ya get to walk out with a fresh baked bread in your happy hand. excited to come again for egg tarts!",
            "The experience here alone is enough to keep me dreaming of coming back.  There's just something about in waiting on a crowded sidewalk, cramming into the small store front, and shouting to order as you pass a wad of cash to the workers that makes walking away with $20 worth of enough dim sum to feed a village that is so truly gratifying.  In short, I felt absolutely victorious after visiting here. And that was before I even ate any of my spoils. Since the demand is through the roof, you never know exactly what will still be available by the time you get pushed to the front of the line, but I was luck enough to sample lo mein (sold by the pound!), sesame balls, shrimp dumplings, bbq pork buns, and sticky rice.  I was full before I even started eating, and loved every single bite.",
            "We had just stopped by Delicious Dim Sum a street away and wanted to compare the offerings at these two places. The line was longer here and we waited roughly 15 minutes. Once we got in the store, the woman was really rude! We were asking her a couple questions and she basically ignored us. She didn't seem happy at all...We got har gow (shrimp dumplings), cha siu bao, potstickers, and shrimp and chive dumplings. They were all huge and prices were very cheap. My favorite was the potstickers because they had lots of fillings and weren't too oily. The cha siu bao had very little filling unfortunately. I will say that the dim sum offerings here were on par with Delicious Dim Sum, perhaps a little better, but the service left a bad taste in my mouth.",
            "Came by to kill some time while waiting for my grandmother during her physical therapy session. Good Mong Kok Bakery has been a popular place for many years. Strictly To-Go but everything is turning over so fast, everything is fresh. My mom was looking for \"Ji Zai Bing\" or \"chicken biscuits\" and this was the place her co-worker had told her that sold them. Meanwhile, i saw FRESH STEAMING CHA SIU BAO so i HAD to get one. Super hot and fluffy. Whats great is their cha siu (bbq pork) is not artificially colored. It's an \"ugly\" brown but i prefer this much more. I've always thought the red was a bit weird, despite how good it tastes HEHE..The steamed cha siu bao was $1.20. Wish i had the time/room to order and eat everything else !",
            "Such a great hole in the wall dim sum place, but it's also got a huge line of people coming in. Bonus, it's full of locals all the time.I've seen people coming in first thing in the morning and people crammed in right before closing. They say the char siu bao are the best at Good Mong Kok, but I have yet to actually try them. Oops. However, the rest of their foods are so damn good, I know I'll have to come back to try the char siu bao one day when I can stomach the people traffic. This is a great stop if you work in the Financial District and want a cheap lunch, but also a great stop if you are nearby. I know I love walking to Chinatown during my lunches or before I head in to work just for a little bit of cheap and yummy eats, and Good Mong Kok is definitely top of my list if I have the time to walk all the way up to Stockton.",
            "Came here after noon and there was a short line leading into a tiny space where you order your stuff and leave. There's literally only enough space for two people to fit from the wall to the screen protecting the food. If you don't know exactly what you want you should look before you get into the store because by the time you can see the entire menu you have to order what you want. They offer a large variety of dim sum that includes your dumplings, baos, congee, and your standard fare. The prices are cheap and portions are reasonable. I tried to order in Chinese and I think I did pretty well because the lady behind the counter understood what I was saying, but I guess she could tell I'm an ABC because she was like, five dollars in English to me. I got some shrimp dumplings and shui mai, they were hot and delicious. The dumpling wrap was made well, not to thick or thin. The shui mai filling was flavorful and delicious.",
            "This is a great cheap dim sum option if you are willing to eat on the sidewalk. There is no seating options and this place is take out only but it is delicious and so worth it! Warning: they run out of items pretty frequently and you have to wait for them to make more. I came here 3 days in a row to finally try everything I wanted to! Everything here is extra large and very filling! On my first visit, they ran out of shu Mai and cha siu bao so I got the shrimp dumplings, rice noodles with beef and some other random dumplings. On my second visit, I was able to get shu mai but no cha siu bao. Finally, third time's the charm! They finally had cha siu baos!I would recommend all dishes except the rice noodles which I felt like was mostly rice noodle and not much meat. The highlights were the shrimp dumplings, shu Mai, and steamed cha siu bao.",
            "Siu Mai (3) for $2.50? Shrimp dumplings (3) for $2.50?I can probably buy 3 days worth of food for under $20 here and the quality of the dim sum is top notch. Much better than the stuff you would find at koi palace or dragon beaux. Skip all that nonsense and get you something real and authentic. My favorite items to get here:Siu Mai Har Gow (shrimp dumpling)Sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf Bbq pork buns Minced meat fried dumplingFried Sesame balls  They open pretty early (7am) and run out of their popular items before noon. No seating available, it is really a stop and go spot. Do not be deterred by the long lines, it moves along pretty fast",
            "This place is amazing~ We wanted to get some dim sum before leaving for our flight and this is the spot we ended up going to. There's no sit down area; it's strictly a to-go place.I couldn't decide which ones I wanted, so I got a little bit of everything. There was no wait when we went but there was a little line after we were done because I was ordering everything haha. But even though I ordered a lot, it still came out to only $16.50! This amount for two people fed us for two meals and they were all super delicious. The only one that I did not enjoy was the shrimp and chives dumpling, but that was relative to everything else.There seemed to be a mixed consensus as to whether this place was cash only or not so I just took cash with me and they seemed to appreciate it lol. They don't have everything on their menu every day, but the ones that they didn't have I didn't really mind haha. Great last eat I. San Francisco before our flight!",
            "We were walking through Chinatown and I was searching \"dim sum\" on Yelp. This place popped up as the first result because it was literally 10 feet in front of us. I saw the line and immediately knew I had to see what the hype was about. This place had the LARGEST steamer trays I've ever seen...they were industrial ones basically. HA crazy to see dim sum in mass like that but it makes sense given how busy they are. There's no seating, just a line and the dim sum ladies asking you what you want right when you step up. Don't expect smiles and pleasantries from them, though you can't blame them given the craziness of the place. We got some ha-gow, beef shu mai, and a pineapple bun. The ha-gow were freaking amazing (not sure if I'm spelling it right). I loved them. They were huge too...biggest ones I've eaten. Shu mai I didn't try but my boyfriend liked them a lot. Pineapple bun was okay maybe 3/5. I like buns with custard inside them and this one didn't have any so I was a little disappointed by that but it was still good, like any other bun. Overall, this is a great little dim sum take out spot that you should definitely check out if you're in the area!",
            "If you're looking for cheap / to-go dim sum in SF Chinatown, look no further than Good Mong Kok. This place usually has a line, but it moves fast and it's a sign that the food here is really good. Walking in, you're greeted by many ready made buns and dim sum dishes. You can pick and choose what is made or you can order off of the giant yellow menu. Everything is amazingly cheap, so I always end up with two huge bags of food. Whatever you buy, you'll have to be ready to eat it outside because there is no space inside the bakery to stand and eat. The employees aren't the nicest either, they kind of want you to just order and leave to keep the line moving. As for food, I actually thought the dim sum is meh. My favorite is probably the har gow (shrimp dumpling) but even that is usually cold from sitting out and the skin is pretty thick. I come to this bakery for THE BREAD. The buns here are amazingly delicious and fragrant. I could eat so many of their Char Siu Bao in one sitting. It's super fluffy and the bbq pork filling is so savory. I've only tried the steamed kind from here but next time I want to try coming early enough to grab a baked version. Good Mong Kok TAKES CARD. They have stickers with VISA symbols on them outside their bakery indicating that they do. However, cash is preferred because it helps the line move quicker.",
            "5 star food. So incredibly cheap and tasty. I only came here because golden gate bakery has been closed for vacation the 3 times I've come to SF in the past 4 years (how is that even possible btw). This to-go only dim sum place is a literal hole in the wall. If you're looking for a fancy sit-down experience, this is not it. You get your dim sum in a plastic container, run outside, and eat it as fast as possible. The interior is just a counter and a bunch of steam trays and you yell at auntie what you want to order. A fast moving line wraps around outside and is probably your only indication you're at the right place.I came here twice during my 3 day stay. Yes I came to Chinatown and searched for and paid for parking just to eat here again.Service? Trash, they're SO mean if you don't know exactly what you want, especially if you only speak English LOL, so be sure to ask for help from people in line if you're confused Layout? So bad, you can't be sure what they have available you just need to askAmbience? Nonexistent Seating? None Health score posted on the wall? AbysmalTaste? Able to surpass all the aforementioned traits. It is so tasty I will give this place, against all better judgement, 5 stars.Just come in here, get your dim sum, and leave as fast as you can. My favorite was the pork siu mai and my boyfriends was the bbq pork bun.P.S. they DO take card.",
            "I finally made it here when they were open! My comment in a review from 2013 on Eastern Bakery alludes to the fact that I tried coming here in freaking 2013 and didn't notice how early they close (6 PM), so I was super excited to finally be back in SF with the ability to pop here when they were open. I have to say, it is absolutely *ridiculous* how cheap food is here. Like, if everything here were literally twice as expensive, it'd still be a pretty good value, nothing that I'm encouraging them or anything. Note that the majority of their menu is a bit cheaper if you buy things in sets of 3s, so it was pretty convenient that we were a group of 3 people, so we just bought 3 of a couple things each and split them, which is totally the way to go if you can swing that. Stuffed our faces on excellent dim sum for like 6-8 bucks each (we left very full). So yes, service is basically nonexistent, but that's not really a bad thing - you say what you want, then you get a bag of dim sum, then you take it and eat it somewhere else (in our case: standing literally right outside the front of the shop), because they are totally a to-go only place. For the price, I am 100% not complaining. (I would've if I'd been waiting 15 minutes like one guy recently, though - that'd be super weird, though, given how quickly orders are taken. We waited like... 2.)As far as the food quality, I personally thought their bao was just decent, as was the sausage roll - the cha siu bao had a decent amount of meat, but not of the highest quality, and the sausage in the sausage roll was good, but tiny (it was mostly dough). So I wouldn't get those again. On the other hand, I'm picky about shumai, and their shumai was the tastiest I've had, by a large margin. I tried the chicken and the beef, and they were both just mindblowingly flavorful. The har gao was also excellent, but the real star of the show, in my opinion, was the \"steamed chives dumpling\", which I wasn't expecting to also have shrimp, so I was a little confused at first, but apparently \"steamed chives dumpling\" means \"basically the same as har gao, but also full of chives\", which is pretty much the greatest thing ever, or at least theirs was, especially for $2.50 for 3 of them.",
            "This is a bargain place for take out dim sum. There's often a line outside and they sell out of many items every day.The individual items are quite large, not the petite size you get in finer dim sum restaurants. The quality isn't the same, also. One good thing is the filling for each kind of dumpling is different, unlike some less expensive places where everything tastes the same. The one thing I did not like is the green peas in the shark fin dumpling. Cheap filler in something that should be a fancy item.The best item I tried was the char shiu bow (barbecued pork bun). It had a very generous amount of barbecued pork filling in a huge steamed bread casing. This item alone would rate a five out of five!Definitely a great value.",
            "3.5 stars for this super popular dim sum place. I was happy that I finally got to go here, since they were closed on vacation the last time I came. You should expect lines out the door during lunch hours (assuming morning is even busier) and lines that don't move quite as quickly as you want them to. They also might be sold out of whatever you're craving, which happened to me. I really wanted a steamed or baked Cha Siu Bao and they were out of both even before noon! So I went with an order of Pork Dumplings (Siu Mai) and Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gao), along with the Sticky Rice with Pork in Bamboo Leaves (Doong or Chinese tamale). Portions were huge and both of the dumplings were fresh and flavorful. You could see and taste the ingredients without the extra fillers that some places use, so that was a plus. There was a lot of rice (maybe too much) in the tamale and a generous piece of pork, a small egg, and that was all. I wish there was Chinese sausage or chestnuts to break up the flavors a bit. It was saltier side too maybe because of this. Don't expect outstanding customer service here. The lady who helped me did not seem very happy at all and had some bad vibes, but I tried to ignore that. Maybe I'll be back to try their other offerings. Maybe.",
            "This hole-in-the-wall does accept credit cards but most people still pay with cash, and I'd recommend it as well. You may be given a look if you try to pay with card, but I appreciate that they try by accepting cards. It's roughly $1.something- $2.something for 3 of each, so it's like you order a set. $1.60 for 3 pineapple buns, I kid you not. $2.50 for 3 shiu mai (regular, beef, or chicken.) It's all takeout so don't expect to eat inside, but it's worth it for the price. I got 21 pieces of shiu mai, 21 pieces of har gow, roughly 15 bbq pork buns, and 3 pineapple buns for less than $60. I was blown-away. The woman who took my order didn't seem to speak English but she understood my broken Chinglish. I didn't taste any MSG and the whole party enjoyed the dim sum wholeheartedly, so I'd say it's great for groups.I will definitely be back to pick some up to-go to share with my grandmother who grew up in Chinatown but has trouble getting there now that she's older.",
            "The best dim sum I've had in a long time.It's a casual deli style where you order the food you want and take it to go. My friends and I got our food and ate at the park about 2-3 blocks around the corner so the no seating situation wasn't a problem! We ordered the shu mai, har gow, sesame balls, bbq pork bao, soy sauce noodles, sticky rice in lotus leaf, and turnip cake and EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. Everything tasted so fresh and flavorful that no other sauces were needed. This is what dim sum should be like -- fast, casual, and focused only on the food. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town!",
            "This little bakery is a Chinatown staple. Yes, there's literally always a line but for good reason. The dim sum is pretty quality, especially for the price, and the perfect spot if you're just craving some xia jiao (shrimp dumplings) for a quick lunch. The prices here are unreal. We're talking $2.50 for 3 pieces of dim sum in San Francisco. They have a pretty large selection of items on the menu. The shrimp dumplings and pork xiao mai are the best dim sum items here, but don't forget about the baked goods. This is a bakery after all! Everyone raves about the steamed BBQ pork buns, but the BAKED BBQ pork buns are miles better and hidden in a case in the back. I also recommend trying the steamed chicken baos. Definitely on the opposite end of the spectrum compared to your typical push-cart, sit-down dim sum brunch affair, but I'm not mad about it. The only kicker is that this place is cash-only and I almost forget to bring cash every time. Pro tip: Don't be intimidated by the line. It goes by relatively fast and you won't regret it!",
            "By far my favorite Dim Sum spot in San Francisco! I randomly stumbled upon this place one day when searching for some good Dim Sum, in what better place than Chinatown! Good Mong Kok did not disappoint. It's a small hole in the wall Bakery, with no indoor seating, but I'm here for some good dim sum, where I'm going to eat it is for later! I've ordered the Shrimp Har gow, the shumai and both the baked and steamed pork bun. Each item was delicious. They offer Big pieces for a super reasonable price. All this costs under 10 dollars. The line can get long, especially around prime time, but it's worth it and typically moves fast. Be advised it is cash only so come ready. Otherwise there's not much else to say other than this spot is one of the best, if not the best dim sum spots in San Francisco, their prices are super reasonable and it's always been a tasty experience!! 5/5 burritos!"

            "Loved this place so much! Everything was perfect from the seafood to the noodles.  Will head straight here every time I'm in town.  It was pretty packed when we got there at 8 pm but worth every second.  Our lovely waitress recommended us the perfect dishes and the right amount of food for our small party of 3.We had the: Steamed Mussels in Garlic Infused Shrimp Broth, Grilled Unagi, Ahi Tuna, Warm Wasabi Noodles, and Deep Fried Salmon Rolls.You really can't go wrong with anything from the menu, but my favorites were the Grilled Unagi and Wasabi Noodles.  We just got 5 small plates and it was the perfect portion for 3 of us.  Everything is flavorful yet well balanced.  I loved the ambiance of the restaurant- small, intimate, and cozy.  Highly recommend. Could not rave about it enough.",
            "Summary:1. Tastes great.2. Good portion sizes for the price.3. Excellent speed of service.4. The flexibility of dessert (see below!!!) The bad:1. Need a reservation (otherwise I don't think you'll be able to get in). We came on a weekday night and it was packed.2. A bit small/cramped. Minor issue.We were seated precisely on time and ordered the following:1. Six half shell oysters (15). Extra-small, deliciously sweet, and better eaten alone without the spicy cilantro sauce. Personally, the sauce was a bit overpowering.2. BBQ ribs with slaw (17). Great taste, although I wish the meat would be a bit more tender. The slaw had a kick to it and paired well with the ribs (please see pictures!).3. Wasabi noodles and steak (26). Our first main course! This probably was my favorite dish because the steak was medium rare and the noodles were delicious. My only gripe is that I wish I could taste the fresh wasabi more (had trouble identifying it).4. Pork chop and mashed potatoes (28). Large portions and very filling. Tastes exactly how it looks (and sounds). OK, so we're pretty full at this point, but when has that ever stopped us from ordering dessert?5. The waitress informed us of a special dessert, which was a warm chocolate bread pudding with fruit. However, there was also a standard coffee ice cream, so we asked if the chef could combine the two. Voila. One of the best desserts I have had in a while. (I can't remember how much this interesting combination cost, but I do know that the table next to us, pointed at it and said, \"I'll have whatever they are having\"...lol.In all, this was a great restaurant and I would love to come back!",
            "3.5 stars, rounded down.The house is located in North Beach - an area filled with Italian food and strip clubs. The restaurant is tiny and the seats are rather cramped in a cozy, non annoying way. The decoration is mild and subtle - it seems to play well on the 'house' theme. The tables chairs and dishes are all simple and well worn, as you'd expect at a family home rather than an upscale restaurant, which adds to the homey and non pretentious vibe of the whole place.The server came and rattled off a long list of specials that, after reading other reviews, don't seem to be a special but rather just menu items that havent yet been printed on the menu. I remembered only a few from the long list so it might help to cut down the specials list, and write it down for people to be able to take it in.We ordered:Grilled unagi - this was a full eel grilled on top of what looked to be rice lightly seasoned with a wasabi mix, topped with bonito flakes. The eel is soft and the rice is also on the mushier side, which creates an overall mushy texture. Tasted good (it's rice and unagi. Never a bad combo) but found nothing notable or special. Could do with some more texture.The famous deep fried salmon - served with salmon roe on top and a side of wasabi heavy salty sauce. The dipping sauce was fantastic - enough wasabi for the wasabi lover but subtle enough for those new to it. The salmon is incredibly moist and not at all heavy. The wasabi cuts through any sense of overwhelming fat to make it just rich enough. Came with a bed of pickled red cabbage slaw. Easy to see why its a Yelp favorite.Wasabi noodles - also another Yelp favorite. This is thick noodles coated with a salty wasabi topped with sliced steak. Some others have noted the lack of a strong wasabi flavor but I thought the wasabi was just enough, and the noodles, though thick, felt like held enough flavor on their own. The steak sort of had no great place on the dish, since the noodles were so great themselves, but overall very tasty!Mushroom rice - a risotto style rice with mushrooms onions and a bunch of other vegetables topped with prawns and bonito flakes. Good, but definitely heavy. The serving is pretty huge especially for how rich it is, and personally I didn't like the texture of the mushroom or the other larger chunks of vegetable that was mixed in with the risotto.A special of the day, spicy miso cod - the presentation is funky and not sure what it's supposed to be but it was kinda cool. A chunk of cod is drowned in a umami miso sauce and topped with a funky shaped avocado roll. The cod was cooked excellently. The sauce was good but nothing complex or out of the world, and the avocado roll was also very common.Overall the food was definitely good, and on paper the dishes sound different and novel. Flavor-wise I didn't really see that.The food came out really impressively fast! The waiters were all bright and friendly, but in the five minutes after we had inhaled the food and were chatting and picking at it, waiters came up to us four times to ask if we were done yet, which made us feel reaaal rushed.",
            "Small but popular place in directly above Chinatown. Judging by the photos, we thought this place would be super no frills but it was surprisingly cozy and intimate. We made a reservation by calling and were seated by a lovely host, although we did have to wait a bit upon arrival (makes sense, they are small). I would describe the cuisine as Asian fusion. Our server was a gem and gave many awesome recommendations, and shared about 4-5 specials for that night. For 3 people, our server suggested sharing: Wasabi Noodles (side) - 5/5 must order if you're a noodle fan- great wasabi taste but not overpoweringFried Salmon Rolls - 3/5 I personally like my salmon raw/rare but this one is cooked since it's deep fried...Manilla Clams - 4.5/5 I loved this dish! Very flavorfulPoke app (special) - 3.5/5 regular poke with avocado and wasabi flairUni App - 5/5 this was much like an eel sushi roll but so much better. Very unique and a hit. Overall, I would definitely return as everything is great here, especially if you like wasabi flavors and seafood things!",
            "The House has been my favorite asian fusion restaurant for years.  I have been visiting this restaurant for over a decade and fondly remember their now closed second location in the Inner Sunset near Golden Gate Park on 9th Avenue.  Actually, I miss that long-gone place as it had a modern air and was at least double the size of the original locale in North Beach on Grant Avenue.  Unfortunately, the surviving site is basic in decor, small, cramped, and noisy, seating about fifty heads at maximum capacity.  Needless to say, reservations are highly recommended, but think twice if your are looking to book a romantic dinner date.  Environment aside, there is a reason why this tiny venue is always packed.  The food is excellent.  Period.  I have never tasted anything less than fantastic here and have so many favorite dishes that deciding what to order is always such a hard decision to make.  For appetizers, the Lobster Tempura and the Blue Lake Bean Tempura are delicious plates to start your meals.  The Warm Kale Salad with Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese & Toasted Pistachios is another great choice.  The Deep Fried Salmon Roll is their signature appetizer which is my favorite.  For entrees, the Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy and the Miso Black Cod with Crab Avocado Maki are must tries - you won't be disappointed!OK, I admit it - I haven't had their desserts in forever, but that is only because if I still have room in my tummy to eat after the main dish, I would gladly order another appetizer...because they are so yummy.  I promise, though, to order a sweet at my next visit, so that I can rate their desserts, too.  I'm convinced that they, too, will be enjoyable.Oh, and service is friendly.  If you go once, I guarantee that you will return!",
            "We picked this place based on the good reviews and proximity to our hotel. It's small, but a really cool and trendy eaterie specializing in Asian seafood. A bit pricey but not outrageous. It was great that we had a reservation as it was packed by the time we left. Service was attentive and not overly pushy. Not a huge menu but enough options to find beef, pork chicken and plenty of seafood and noodle dishes. Beer and wine only.The shrimp dumplings were not the best I've had but were still quite delicious. We also munched on barbecued squid which was phenomenal. My wife and I split the sea bass, which came with garlic noodles and green beans. A good sized dish which was quite balanced with the light and delicate fish paired with the decadent garlic noodles. Simply fabulous. The other dish was a halibut special under a heavier mushroom sauce. Very tasty. Fresh green tea and a wonderful passion fruit crepe brûlée finished us off. We would have preferred to stay longer but, with a line out the door, we decided to grab a drink elsewhere.",
            "Tried several of the appetizers, all were flavourful and also had the wasabi noodles.  Overall really good dishes and the service was over the top.",
            "YES, finally got to try this place after walking by and seeing it always packed. We came around 6pm with a reservation, which definitely helps but not sure if needed on a weekday. Wasn't overly packed, but definitely good business throughout the night. Was super excited to try this place and the dishes are full meals. For some reason, I thought it would be a small-plate, tapas style restaurant, but thankfully it wasn't. Sea bass w/ garlic noodles was hands down my favorite. MMMMM. Delicious - I could eat it over and over. Ordered the other noodle dish - wasabi noodles with steak, and it was good, with super bold flavors. However, everything just tasted so... strong - felt it lacked a little balance and complement to the overall dish.Salmon rolls are overhyped. Good but just a one time thing. Passion fruit creme brulee was good but not special enough for the price.Ordered a bottle of sake for $45 dollars. Saw the same exact bottle & brand at an Asian grocery store for $10. The markup is insane, and felt like docking a star out of contempt.",
            "This is definitely one of those places that you have to try if you ever get a chance.  It can get pretty crowded here, but luckily I've never had to wait to get seated.  There are so many different options on the menu here - I'll try to describe everything I've ordered before so it's easier for you to decide.  One day I'll try them all.+ Clams in spicy miso broth:  Great appetizer choice.  The spicy miso isn't too spicy, but its so flavorful and delicious.  The clams are tender and cooked really well.  If you order this, I recommend saving the broth to eat with some of your other dishes (ie. the mashed potatoes that might come with your dish, or the wasabi noodles!)+ Wasabi noodles with steak:  Good entree or plate to share for the table.  I was a bit scared to try this at first because I'm not too fond of wasabi, but this was delicious.  The wasabi wasn't overpowering at all (it tasted like just a hint).  This was kind of like an elevated chow mein dish, which I really enjoyed.  The steak it came with was seasoned well and tender.+ Seabass with wasabi noodles:  It was good, but I probably wouldn't order this specific dish again.  The seabass was cooked pretty well - flaky and moist on the inside (maybe a little overcooked, but it was close to perfect).  The flavor was alright - definitely not as bold as some of their other entrees here.  The bed of wasabi noodles tasted exactly like the entree version (see above).+ Hamachi special:  THIS IS IT.  If they are serving this when you come here, you are in luck.  I dream about this entree.  The fish is so flaky and so flavorful.  The vegetables underneath continue the flavor explosions in your mouth and complement the dish so, so well.  And the sushi-like rolls that come on top with it is like the icing on the cake.  This is one of the best things I've ever had.+ Seared scallops:  They might not look like much, but they are SO GOOD.  Incredible appetizer choice.  The sear on the scallops was so good, and the inside was still translucent and moist.  The crispiness you get at the beginning of your bite (from the sear) blends into the juicy, soft scallop on the inside to give you a bite of food that leaves you wanting more.  Whatever that sauce/oil is on the plate is really good too, be sure to get some of that on your scallop.+ Fried salmon rolls:  This was just OK - probably would not order again.  It's basically a salmon egg roll.  It was a bit too oily for me, but the salmon flavor definitely comes through.+ Pomegranate pork chop:  Also just OK - probably would not order this again either.  The presentation and concept are wonderful, but I just thought this dish was a bit too heavy with the side of mashed potatoes.  The pork chop was actually cooked amazingly - it was still really tender and juicy.  The pomegranate sauce was really cool as well, but my friend mentioned that it kind of tasted like Sweet & Sour pork at Panda, and it tasted like that for the rest of the meal.  Couldn't get that one out of my head :(Overall, the amount of options you have here and the level at which they execute these dishes will blow you away.On top of the amazing food they serve here, the service is spectacular.  From the moment you're seated until you leave, they take care of you.  The House really is a top notch restaurant, and it shows in everything they do.TLDR - Come here.",
            "Giving this place another review because it's probably the best restaurant I have been too. Everything they serve.... Is 5 stars. It's also affordable too with the most expensive item being $35. Food: Had the Ribeye Steak (5/5) and grilled octopus (6/5). The steak was cooked perfectly, was a quality cut of meat, and packed with flavor. Served a better steak than most of the steakhouses I have been to in sf where it's 2x the price. As for the grilled octopus... Alot of places don't know how to get theirs tender and you end up with a chewy octopus. Not here... If you like grilled octopus and great flavor to go with it, look no more.Service: 5/5. Friendly staff and watch for when drinks are getting low. They also pack up your food for you.As I said at the start, this might be the best restaurant I have been to. Every.Single.Thing is good",
            "Perennial North Beach restaurant favorite and early pioneer of Asian Fusion, The House is a reliable spot for delicious plates in a cozy and homey setting. The House is open for lunch and dinner. The former is a much quicker and causal affair while you can take your time over a wider menu later in the day. Share some small plates. The ahi tuna tartar is fresh and well seasoned. The simple grilled eel over sushi rice and avocado is just so satisfying. Crispy salmon roll brings the best of a nori roll and a spring roll - yum! And you need to order the famous sea bass - one of Zagat's 10 must eats in the city. Excellently prepared, the fish is crispy around the edges, moist on the inside, and the garlic/ginger soy packs a great flavor punch. The service is professional and friendly. Not the largest space so it can get a little loud at capacity but overall, as its name suggest, a comfortable spot for delicious food that makes one feel right at home.",
            "Definitely not feeling the same love for this place as a lot of people but still a very solid spot for fake-asian food if that's what you're in the mood for. Place was pretty packed on a Friday night (popularity evidenced by 4000+ yelp reviews) so would highly recommend making a reservation in advance. At three dollar signs was surprised to see that the inside looks pretty plain and not upscale at all. The interior feels more like a sushi restaurant that you would find at your local strip mall. That being said, the food was quite good with some highlights / lowlights below:-unagi rice - never had eel served like this with avocado before (welcome to Cali lol) but was really tasty. Bonito flakes on top were a great touch-grilled shrimp with mushroom rice - we loved the risotto-like rice with mushrooms underneath and you get a pretty healthy sized serving of shrimp on top-halibut special - found this hard to classify as \"Asian fusion\" of any sort. It was basically a grilled piece of halibut on a bed of mashed potatoes and cream sauce. Pass on this as there was nothing really special about it-wasabi noodles with steak - wanted more kick from the wasabi on this one. Tasted like plain yakisoba with a hint of ketchup with a steak randomly dropped on topThis place definitely isn't real asian food by any means and is probably more geared towards an American palate but it's still pretty good. A little expensive for a date spot considering the interior isn't anything romantic or special but would be good for a group dinner!",
            "Really solid food that consistently tastes delicious, any dish you get.  So may great flavors.  Great price and great service.  The people here are really friendly.  The only thing negative review is how close everyone is to each other, you can barely get to the inside of your seat.  It's a little claustrophobic, especially when it is crowded, people are waiting to get in, and the staff cleaning and serving.  Parking is a pain here, it's on a one way street.  Better to take a car here and walk around for there are many bars and places to get a drink after.  Try and make reservations, it is always packed here.",
            "Make sure to make a reservation in advance.  Place is small inside and gets super packed!Their food!!!! SOOOO GOOD!!! Ordered salmon fried rolls.  Reminded me of lumpia made of salmon, crispy in the outside and soft in the in.  Tasty.  The unagi was on point!! HELLA GOOD!! Super soft, sweet yet good.  Highly, highly recommend.  I ordered the sea bass with no regrets.  It was seared and melted in my mouth with every bite.  The noodles are a good carb hit.  My husband ordered the steak. WOOOOWW!!! Fat steak portion that blankets the mashed potatoes.  VERY GOOD!!!",
            "Overall 3.5 stars, but wanted to give some nuance to the overall rating. This place is a convenient spot for a dinner if you work in Fidi and don't have an existing reservation - my friend and I were able to walk in at prime dinner time on a Friday. The pros: the daily specials (appetizers and mains) are great additions to the menu. The menu has plenty of seafood options and offer interesting ingredient pairings to make the Asian fusion dishes interesting. The service is (very) attentive and quick, though it can feel like you're being ushered out once you're done with your meal.I ordered the miso cod special, and the cod was tender and cooked well. The sushi roll on top was just ok, though, and didn't particularly add much to the dish.The flavor is quite good, but reasonable people can debate whether it's worth the $$$ price range.",
            "This little restaurant, just off Columbus Avenue, in San Francisco's North Beach, is our favorite restaurant. And it may not be ours only. It is usually crowded. The 15 or so tables fill up as soon as the doors open. You should make reservations...or wait outside. There really no room inside. So, prepare for an hour or more in the cold. It will be worth it, though. The Asian fusion cuisine is consistently delightul. If you miss the old Slanted Door (before it moved to the Ferry Terminal and got ever so pretentious and expensive), you will love the House. Though it has a smaller menu, it manages to be everything that was good about the Slanted Door.I have to be forced to not order the Angus flatiron steak with a roasted shitake sauce ($23), served over noodles. It had always been on the menu and it's always great. But my choice this time may be a new favorite: warm wasabi House noodles with grilled pork ($15) intervened! A few red chile bits threatened heat, but even my wife (who can't tolerate heat at all) found it delcious and bearable. The rest of the family, given a taste from the leftovers, fought over who could finish it.The restaurant keeps many things thankfully on the menu forever but also experiments with a few others. The grilled octopus with tempura potatoes and a sriracha aoli was not a success, IMO. There was just way too much soft breading with the teeniest little octopus tentacles poking out of it. Mostly it tasted like the faintest seafood flavored fried dough. Hey, maybe that's a new thing!The sesame topped, soy glazed, king salmon my wife ordered looked great, but meant to be eaten mostly raw. It is not a taste I have acquired but to each her own.",
            "When I visited San Francisco, the one thing I knew I wanted to do was have dinner at The House! I had heard so many great compliments about this restaurant from friends and I needed to try it. We made a reservation (and I highly recommend you do the same, this place is super small and always packed). It was 6 of us at the table and we decided to order a bunch of different things off of their menu and just share it all. I am so glad we did that because everything was so delicious, flavorful and cooked to perfection. We were so excited about our meals, I totally forgot to take photos except for one! We loved our food and I know you will too - this place is a must try! Side note: you can only split the check two ways at the restaurant so go prepared for that.",
            "One of the most unique and flavorful fusions. Yes, it seems pricy, but trust me by the end of the night it's well worth it. Excellent date spot. Cozy little place, with exceptional food.",
            "Came here during a conference in SF and I really enjoyed my meal. From the opening glass of wine and the pickled cucumber appetizer I was revved up and ready to eat. The diver scallop appetizer was fresh and cooked to a perfect consistency. The sea bass was seasoned well and balanced perfectly with the garlic string beans and wok fried noodles.  Every bite was a wonderful blend of texture and flavors. The Creme brûlée was a perfect ending to my meal.",
            "The House is a hidden gem in the middle of Telegraph Hill. This is my second time visiting the restaurant, and I was equally impressed. I came this time with my girlfriend to celebrate an occasion. We had made a prior reservation by phone call earlier in the week for 8pm. After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, we were kindly seated and handed menus. We were told seasonal specials and also personal recommendations from a waitress. Onto what we ordered:Grilled Octopus, Tempura Potatoes, Sriracha Aioli - One of the best octopus dishes I've ever had! The octopus is cooked perfectly... so tender! And the tempura potatoes are like pillows of starch that give you the perfect mouth feel when eating them. Would recommend this dish to anyone who comes to this restaurant.Soft-shelled Crab with Cold Korean Noodles - One of the seasonal specials that we had. The soft shell crab was plated beautifully, and was extremely crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. The cold Korean noodles provided a sweet refreshing taste to the dish and went perfectly with the crispy seafood.Toasted Bread with Mussels - Classic dish. This was another seasonal special on their menu. Great buttered bread and the mussels were seasoned nicely!Sesame soy glazed king salmon in a bonito sake broth - Perfectly cooked salmon with fresh Chinese vegetables and a light broth! Such a refreshing entree to end our meal. Broth was flavorful and vegetables were fresh and crisp.Overall, a perfect date spot for a potential significant other or someone that you've been with for a while, or just a friend. You won't be disappointed with the food that you order here!"

            "Good late night food to sober you up from being DRuNk, partying or getting off work if you so happen to work in the nightclub industry like I did in my 20's.SAM WOO is a historical SF spot that wasn't really touristy when I used to live there in SF. I have very fond memories of this place. This is why you should go:-It's cheap ($3.75 for rice porridge - I mean this was before 2011) -It's open late-large menu-tasty for the price: you're drunk anyways so everything tastes good at that point-quick service: and yes the server knows your drunk and you're probably obnoxious but still deals with your ass I mean, this isn't a Michelin 5 star dining experience so don't even try to compare it to that-its your local Chinese Dive hole-in-the-wall. So go get chocolate wasted and come here afterwards. Bye!",
            "Stopped by this place today for lunch. Ordered a simple Wonton Soup for $6.99. Wouldn't recommend it unless you want something flavorless. The broth literally tasted like plain water BUT the wontons were decently made. Their soup doesn't have any added vegetable in the soup (like cabbage, or chinese broccoli) like most of the other restaurants nearby. Worst part was the service though. Normally terse chinese service doesn't bother me much, but one waitress with bangs was being particularly aggressive towards me. She was super impatient with my order and kept insisting I should order more.Finally I understood why. They have a $10 card minimum, but they won't just charge you $10 if you don't have cash. I was fine with paying the $10 but she insisted I had to buy more things to get me over the $10min. I said I'd go to an ATM but then she insisted I leave my whole backpack there if I left. So bizarre and perhaps a bit racist? Either way, I wasn't going to do that with my laptop in the bag. We had a really unpleasant back & forth until I finally had to buy 2 sodas to leave. Never returning here again.",
            "As a native of New York's Chinatown, who shops/dim sums in Brooklyn's Chinatown, and now lives in the Queens Chinatown, I was pretty excited to try one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in SF's Chinatown! I met a friend here late Wednesday night and tried a little of  the duck fried rice and wonton soup (I had already eaten). The wontons are uniquely crunchy with the chestnut, and the duck fried rice was delicious! Good portion and flavor. Did I mention there was 8+ big wontons in there?! We lost count. Unfortunately we left right after a group of ten tipsy young'uns came up to the second floor, and of course they were loud and obnoxious.On my last night in SF after a long day at work, I couldn't resist ordering takeout from Sam Wo. The food via grubhub came in 30 minutes! I got the same duck fried rice and also beef tendon wonton soup. It was as good as the previous night. I saved 3/4 of the huge box of rice and 4 wontons for lunch (at the airport the next day).So all in all, yummy Chinese food, amazing portions - good to eat there if there aren't loud tipsy people. Also great for takeout orders! Will definitely eat there next time I'm in SF.",
            "How cute that this place has a photo booth right outside their door you can email yourself! This place has both an upstairs and downstairs, but ONE unisex bathroom. We sat downstairs and the stools were a little tiny. The wings were not as good as Capital but still very tasty. Their soup, rice, and chow fun was all very delicious. The service is fast too so if you're looking for something quick, this is your joint. Another great place in Chinatown!",
            "Sam Wo Restaurant was a great late-night dining option in Chinatown.  We wanted to eat in Chinatown at least once during our visit to San Francisco, and I was not disappointed with our choice to visit Sam Wo.  The atmosphere was authentic, the food was delicious, the portions were large and a good value, the service was good.We started off with the Chinese Donuts.  They were really similar to fry bread - not really sweet, but a little savory.  They were great for dipping, whether in sauce or I would imagine soup.  We also ordered the Fried Spring Roll appetizer, which was delicious.  Stuffed to the bursting with cabbage and a very nice tangy dipping sauce.  The order was a good size for 2-3 people to share.  For our main dishes, I chose the Sweet & Sour Chicken, while my significant other ordered the Duck Chow Mein.  While both dishes were delicious, the Sweet & Sour Chicken really stole the show.  The Duck Chow Mein was nice, and the noodles were cooked well.  The Sweet & Sour Chicken was perfectly done, not soggy at all with the breading, and the vegetables cooked just as much as you'd want them, but no more.  The sauce was fantastic and addicting.  Writing this makes me wish I was able to have some more now!  I would recommend visiting Sam Wo, and I would definitely visit again.  Between the delicious food and the affordability, it was a good spot for dinner.  I'll be dreaming about that Sweet & Sour Chicken for a while.",
            "This place is in the heart of china town and is a perfect hole in the wall restaurant if you're looking for traditional Chinese dishes. There is an entire second floor, so don't let the small first floor deceive you.I thought the food here was really great, we ordered an assortment of dishes. Fish porridge, preserved egg porridge, Mongolian beef,Barbecue pork rice noodle roll, duck chao Mai fun, Tofu squares appetizers, Chinese doughnut,House chow fun, fried rice.I would have to say my two least favorite dishes were the Mongolian beef and the Preserved egg porridge. I found the Fish porridge to have a lot more flavor than the preserved egg porridge, which barely had a few pieces of preserved egg anyways. It was mainly the porridge that was a bit bland, in my opinion. The Mongolian beef was not as seasoned as I would've liked. It was very saucy and appetizing to look at, but upon taking a bite you realize it needed more spices. All the other dishes were a win for me!",
            "Hi I been around looking for a good Chinese restaurant in San Francisco, I got to this place and i found a waiter or security at the door he straight up told me they only are taking take outs at 12:19 am, I feel really upset because I asked the lady at the cashier if I can dine in and she told they are open until 3 am , but apparently the guy at the front is racist his attitude personality, etc. please if you are not Asian don't come to this place and the food is not good.",
            "Wow. This place has really gone downhill. The chow fun was about Panda Express level quality... maybe not even. The jook/congee was just ok. The chicken wings was probably the only bright spot. This spot is worse than your usual Chinese take out. Maybe if you came very very drunk... and had never had proper Chinese food before.Bye. Prob won't bother coming again.",
            "I didn't eat in the restaurant but ordered online and picked it up. Really fast!I was feeling under the weather and wanted some comfort food. The congee at this place is pretty on par with something I would make at home. At first when ordering, I was a little taken aback by the $11 price tag for congee, but when you pick it up you'll see why. The portions are HUGE. It's enough to feed at least 2 people and I have enough leftover for dinner. The consistency to their congee is thick and not watery and they do not skimp on the ingredients. I ordered the thousand year old eggs with pork and there were pretty decent sized chunks of egg throughout the container. Def will come back to try more of their menu.",
            "I was expecting some better Chinese food because of the reviews. I was looking for something good to eat late at night and found this place. Maybe it's because I'm used to some quality Chinese food in flushing NY, but I thought the food here was just alright. I would come here if it's like 2 AM and nothing else is open. However, I wouldn't choose to come here when all the other amazing restaurants in SF are still open :/",
            "This place has improved!  And is very good!!!I haven't been here in 15 years but the interior is greatly improved and the food is very good.  The restaurant is still tiny and you need to wait to be seated upstairs and down.  It doesn't matter if you go there for lunch dinner or at 2:00 am - expect to wait.  But the wait is worth it!  I haven't had anything I didn't like but am a sucker for their Ma Po Tofu.  Delicious.  Local trick - get the Chinese donut and dip it in the soup.  Sweet and salty - incredible.I used to go here when I was in high school and college.  It was notorious for not serving beer or wine but relatively easy to sneak beer upstairs and eat average Chinese food with your underage friends.  Don't see any kids with beers anymore and the food is way above average.",
            "Sam Wo was an okay experience. The restaurant is two story and is very narrow - but the line is long!We got the house chow mein, sweet and sour chicken, shrimp rice roll, and beef and broccoli. The food wasn't exactly amazing, but it wasn't bad either. My favorite was the sweet and sour chicken for sure. The restaurant is very narrow and you will definitely be bumped into when sitting down. The service was good, I don't regret going.",
            "Sam Wo is the best Chinese place in San Francisco.  This storied restaurant dates back over 100 years.  I remember coming to the original Sam Wo's as a kid with my family and cramming around a small table to enjoy their delicious food.  The new restaurant still carries on the great tradition of Sam Wo and offers the same amazing food customers from around the world have come to love.  I am so happy Sam Wo is back open and here to stay!",
            "Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: A good option for a late night meal but it was just ok.The extended review...Food:Duck Chow Fun - So I was very excited about this because usually the only duck you can get with a noodle dish is a soupy noodle dish.  The only issue I found was that it was just a tad greasy which I kind of expect from a Chinese restaurant but for some reason i felt like it compromised the taste of the noodles.Service: Normal service for a Chinese place.Ambiance: Very casual and feels like old school Chinatown.",
            "A trip to Chinatown isn't complete without visiting the oldest Chinese restaurant. The dingy diner has a narrow first floor with stairs in the back to go up to a second floor. The food was decent and service was good. We tried the vegetable fried rice, garlic stir fried broccoli and an order of donuts. It all tasted fresh but nothing was phenomenal in flavor. The overall experience was okay but I doubt we'll return for another visit.",
            "Decent spot for a quick meal in Chinatown if you're looking for Cantonese classics such as noodle soups, congee / rice porridge, stir fried noodles, fried rice, and rice plates.I came for lunch on a Saturday around 12:30. Unfortunately I ran into the peak lunch rush and had to wait maybe 10-15 minutes before getting seated. I think there's a second floor as I heard the workers talk about upstairs seating, but I was seated on the first floor and didn't have a chance to check it out.I was starving so decided order both an appetizer and entree. I have a thing for chicken wings, so I went for the salt and pepper chicken wings ($7.75). It came with 7 wings instead of 6 as indicated on the menu, but I'm definitely not complaining about more food! It was tender and juicy but there were still some soft skin I could taste, so it didn't seem to be fried enough. The flavor was perfect with just enough salt and pepper.I also ordered the wonton noodle soup with beef stew ($8.25), as it was marked as a Sam Wo special. It was a much bigger bowl than expected (came with ~6 wontons), and after finishing all the wings, I was already getting full. The beef, which was probably my favorite part of this dish, was soft and melted in my mouth, especially the beef tendon. One minor complaint: there were some spices in the soup I wish they had ladled out instead of including. I started biting into some of them only to spit it out.Food is served pretty quickly here. I got my wings within 10 minutes of ordering, which is pretty fast given how busy they were. Service was pretty good as well. There were always plenty of workers walking around so it was easy to flag someone down.I'd definitely come back to try some of their other items.",
            "Great spot for a cold rainy night. We went on a Sunday night and waited 15 minutes before we got seated. There's a few tables downstairs and another section upstairs where we sat. My friend and I decided to share the Chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle, duck fried rice, and beef stew noodle soup. The portions were generous for their price and we had leftovers! Taste wise is decent, but it didn't excite me. All 3 dishes were average compared to other Chinese restaurants. Staff was busy all night but they were attentive.This is located in Chinatown so there's a lot of fun spots to check out nearby!",
            "I would say this was a solid 3.5. It's a hole in the wall, the food was hot, good, but certainly not a killer. It just didn't have great flavor's. We had combo won ton and a flat noodle dish wish veggies. This is a great place for late night eating and take out.",
            "We were hungry after a day out sightseeing and found this restaurant near by and close to Union Station area hotels. We had an amazing dinner and service was great. Chicken chow main and wonton soup that we shared with plenty of food for 2 people, walked back to the hotel after dinner. Best meal and deal in San Francisco",
            "Sam Wo is a family-owned business that's been running for over 100 years and has a deep history rooted in SF Chinatown. I've heard all about Sam Wo for decades but haven't visited until recently. Maybe it's the hype, maybe it's the press, maybe it's the reopening, but I had pretty high expectations for Sam Wo. Unfortunately, everything came up short. BBQ Pork Rice Noodle Roll - one of the, if not the, most popular dish here. The rice noodle was thick and hard. The BBQ pork was bland and dry. Ask for mustard, hot sauce, or soy sauce to give this some flavor. Fish Jook - some people like their porridge super watery while others like it thick, to each their own. I actually like the consistency of the porridge here since it's between the two. However, for a Fish Jook, the fish is supposed to be the star of dish and it wasn't very fresh so it came out very bland. Beef Stew Noodle Soup - beef was tender and noodles had the right chewiness to it. Although the broth could be a bit richer, this dish always hits the spot. Duck Chow Mai Fun - more like lo mai fun instead of chow mai fun, but I think it tastes better this way. The sauce gives the noodles a nice savory and fragrant aroma to it."

            "We were on our way to Good Mong Kok Bakery and saw a small line outside Delicious Dim Sum. We decided to make a stop and compare the dim sum from the two places. We waited about 10 minutes until we ordered. The restaurant is grab-and-go with a few tables, so most people just bought dim sum and walked away with it, which is what we did as well. Definitely a hole in the wall place!We got some har gow (shrimp dumplings), potstickers, shumai, cha siu bao, and shrimp and chive dumplings. Everything was huge and so cheap! We paid maybe $15 and fed 3 people! I will say that service was good for us because we spoke in Chinese to the woman, but I can see why service may be lacking if you speak English. Between Delicious Dim Sum and Good Mong Kok, I'd definitely prefer Delicious because Good Mong Kok had pretty rude service....see my next review.",
            "This place is good if you are trying to grab a quick bite to eat. The day I went there was a long line but it went by pretty fast. I was nervous they would be out of certain things since it was past normal lunch hour but everything was stocked well and seemed very fresh. The place itself is very small and narrow with not really any sit down and everything is put in Togo containers for you to take wherever you go. Most of the foods come in orders of 3 for about ~2$ more or less. So I was able to get 4 dishes for 10$. NOTE: if your order is under 10$ it has to be cash. I ordered: shrimp dumpling, shrimp and chives, egg rolls, and pot stickers. All was really good and kept fresh even for Togo. If you ever in the area definitely worth a try.",
            "Recently I've had the strongest cravings for dumplings and steamed buns, apparently I'm in just the right place to get my fix.But, as always, there's a caveat.After a brief Yelp search, I came across this place which had been reviewed by none other than my very own Yelp Community manager (hi, Kimi!). That made it an easy choice.I walked the mile or so from my office, through the steep and busy streets of downtown, until I found little place, tucked on a small street in Chinatown.As I waited to place my order, I noticed that the menu was a lot smaller then the picture I saw on Yelp. Namely, there were a few vegetable buns that were no longer on the menu. As I place my order for shrimp dumplings, flea market to the woman behind the counter that there are so many things on the menu I want to try but I can't because I don't eat pork. She informed almost everything on the menu contains pork. Even the shrimp dumplings.What?!How?!I felt so betrayed.Finally, I told her to just give me an order of everything that did not contain pork. I ended up with an order of beef shumai, lotus seed paste buns, Sesame balls, and spring rolls. Not sure if she was being genuine or try to be funny, but after she filled my order, the lady behind the counter gave me a business card for a nearby vegetarian Chinese restaurant. *shrug* I'll take it.The food was all very good. The beef shumai was  the largest I've ever seen; bursting at the seams with delicious, well-seasoned beef. The sesame balls were full of yummy red bean paste (my fave!). The spring rolls were crispy and delicious, and the cabbage inside still had a nice crunch to it. And while I was really hoping to feast on an order of savory steamed buns, the lotus seed paste bun was a sweet consolation. The dough was soft, chewy and ever so slightly sweet, with just enough of the thick, sweet paste inside.I think I'm going to need a nap after this...",
            "Food: 3/5    Price: 5/5     Service: 1/5    Ambience: 1/5Quick takeout dim sum place in SF Chinatown. Small shop, terrible service, good food.Pork and vegetables bao (3 for $2.30) - 3/5. Ok pork filling without a lot of juice, ok bun.Su mai (3 for $2.50) - 4/5. Delicious pork flavor!",
            "Absolutely what I was expecting and more from looking at reviews on here prior to going. You can be reasonably full for less than $10 here easily. I just was craving dim sum and went to town and ordered tons of random stuff. Anything with shrimp was the highlight for me. Especially the shrimp and chive dumplings. This is going to be a reoccurring craving now. The employees also were very nice, and helpful. Be prepared for a long line, it definitely had the longest line of all the places in the area. Well worth it though, and it easily earns a 5 out of 5.",
            "Great place! I got a set of pork siu Mai, shrimp dumplings, sticky rice with chicken, char siu Bao, custard bao & red bean puff and thousand egg puff for $16.6 total! What a great price.I love their siu mai and shrimp dumplings. Their char siu bao was huge but with little fillings. It's understandable given the price, but personally I would prefer having the size smaller so that the pork-bun ratio would be better.I was hungry so I started eating part of my take-away food in store. The staff was very nice that she came over to offer a better soy sauce and chatted with me. I told her I came from NY and she asked me about housing in NY. I complained about the Wall Street people pushing the rent & sale market high while she accused the local tech people for the same thing haha! It was such a fun and informative conversation. She was so friendly and considerate. Would love to come back!",
            "3.5 stars. The food is cheap, but that's Dim Sum. It's one of the few places that also accepts CC for a purchase, but you have to spend a Minimum $10. You pay the 2% CC fee (they use Square). Bring a bag if you plan on ordering a lot b/c they charge an extra fee if you want a bag to carry out your stuff. Which you most likely will have to b/c they have 1 table.  ~~Parking:  Street parking b/c it's in Chinatown, but you've probably parked somewhere else already and you're just looking for a place to eat. ~~Service: Ok. The man that was serving me and my fam was nice, but he handed us over to a woman that was NOT. She was the one ringing us up to and gave us the utensils and sauces. I had asked for forks and sauces, since the employees were eating their lunch/dinner at the one table inside the place and she provided enough forces for us but only 1 soy sauce and 1 chili sauce packet, sadness. ~~Best Part: Their har Gao (shrimp dumpling) is pretty good along with their chive and shrimp dumpling. ~~Worst Part: Service and some of the food. Would NOT recommend getting the Shanghai dumpling (if you've had really good ones before). The skin is hard and there's no \"soup\" inside. ~~Tips: If you only have a CC and want dim sum, then go here. But there's a lot of ATMs around chinatown for a lot of banks. So I would recommend hitting up an ATM, getting cash, and actually going to Dim Sum Bistro (yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-bis…) which is just a couple of streets over. ~~Return: prob not, just because there's so many other dim sum places around Chinatown and I prefer the Bistro's",
            "Cash only! We had this for an early lunch and there wasn't much of a line. Loved everything, but wish they were hotter. The shrimp rice rolled noodles were so good but there was too much noodle compared to the amount of shrimp.They're very nice here! Can't go wrong with their stuff here!",
            "Visited Chinatown today in San Francisco and while walking around we decided to give this place a try, seeing their 4 stars on yelp.  Its a quintessential hole in the wall.  Easy to miss except for the huge line going out the door.  But inside they have their counter full of different dim sums,  1 small table in the corner and 3 chairs to sit and wait for to go orders.  Then a little kitchen in the back to make the dimsum.  A truly authentic chinese dimsum place without the hastle of the push cart ladies trying to dump more dishes on you.  Everyine who works here is from china, and when you know many of the people buying dimsum are local chinese people, this place must be good.  Freshly made, as the cook in the back was continuously bringing more dimsums from the back.  They have a good selection of different dimsums, from shumais to buns to dumplings to spring rolls to chicken feet to seasame balls and others.  They have a total of 34 items.  And the pricing is very cheap, many of them being around $2.30 for 3 pieces.The actual food is really good, and I can see why they have a 4 star rating!!  Extremely hot.  Not too oily unless you get the seasame ball.  Flavors are good.  Lots of shrimp in the different shrimp dimsums.  Just tasted so good.  They prefer cash but you can use card on orders of $10 or more.  I spent about $15 and had enough not only for lunch but dinner as well.  If you're in Chinatown looking for an authentic dimsum place, give this place a try,  you won't regret it!!!",
            "Best thing I got was the chive and shrimp dumpling. My friend took one bite and stared at me for a good minute. Then she said it was godly.",
            "The restaurant is very small with only a few tables, which we knew before hand so we already decided to do a take-out order. We made it there around a half hour to closing so some of the more popular items had been sold out as expected but there was still plenty variety to choose from. There was no problem communicating with the lady working the front and when I asked for something that was sold out, she suggested other options that were similar. Everything we tried was delicious and it was SUPER cheap. My only complaint is that most of our food wasn't too hot, but that could've been because we got there close to their closing time.",
            "Not as good as good mong Kok for their shu mai but still pretty good for the amount - bought some frozen as well as some fresh ones to share and will definitely be back for more. Only reason why I went here was because good mong Kok is closed on Thursdays and Fridays",
            "Very fortunate there wasn't a long line for this place this go around.  My wife and I always make it a point to come here each time we are in the Bay area to get some no fuss, no frills, cheap authentic dim sum to go.  This time, we just opted for an order (one order = 3 pieces) of the Chiu Zhou Dumplings and they were a little disappointing.  The filling was very hot and flavorful but the skin was just a tad bit too thick for my liking.  Therefore, my 4 star rating is indicative of what I have had in the past and I will just deem this one poor experience as an aberration.",
            "Nice hole in the wall dim sum place; very well priced and in the heart of Chinatown. However space was limited to 1 table. The food tasted very authentic and the portions were good!",
            "We went there on Saturday noon, we got really lucky since there were no line and we also even got seat(there was only a small table in the entire place which can fit 4 ppl.) right after we sat down the line got super long. They lists dim sum in term of 3 pcs, but just tell her if u only want one, they r usually willing to divide the cost to just let u try. I got so much food and only spent 10 dollars, I literally couldn't finish half. I highly recommend the shumai and the shrimp dumpling, and I DO NOT recommend the bbq pork bun and the radish cake. For those who wants to eat nearby, there is a park but usually really crowded.",
            "Pros: Authentic, inexpensive, delicious food, large portions, and friendly staff. A hole in the wall that is DEFINITELY worth it!Cons: parking and one table to sit.Even though there is only one table, my family and I enjoyed eating while standing outside on the sidewalk; it was a fun and memorable experience!",
            "Stopped by here early on a Thursday morning.  The interior is very small with enough seating for honestly 2 people (we were fortunate to get the table).  The menu has your typical dim sum items but because the location is really meant for take-out, the prices were pretty good especially when compared to Boston.  For $7 you can definitely get enough dim sum to satisfy one person (they also let you order single items if you want to try multiples unlike sit down restaurants).  Overall I was quite happy with what they served and if you're in the area give them a go!",
            "The food was a letdown.  The beef and shrimp rice noodles were over cooked.  The pork dumplings had tasty filling but the skin was tough.  Yelp has typically been reliable but this place was a \"fail.\"",
            "Absolutely no frills kind of dim sum place. There's only 1 table, so it's mostly a take out type of establishment. The options are plenty, the prices are crazy good, and the quality is awesome. Two adults can easily get full off of around $15!"

            "Great place for groups!! Delicious sangria - almost too good - tasted like juice. Had to be careful! Fun atmosphere, good service & good food. Will be back sometime for sure.",
            "Decent Spanish restaurant in the city. My friends and I came across this restaurant in our search for a place to have lunch in the area.The atmosphere was chill and I liked the Spanish decorations around the restaurant.  We ordered the serrano croquettes, patatas bravas and the black paella. The appetizers were very mediocre. The patatas bravas were super spicy and soaked in an incredible amount of oil. I'm from Spain, and I've never seen patatas bravas served with oil. We all hate to leave food when we go out to eat, but we could not finish them. The serrano croquettes were also not my favorite. They were pretty strong and I was a bit confused trying to figure out what the filling was made of. I don't think it was bechamel based. My friends enjoyed them though. The only highlights were the black paella and the service. The paella wasn't too badly priced ($35), especially when compared with other Spanish restaurants in SF. When it first came out, I was a bit skeptical seeing how much sauce it had. However, the taste was amazing and it was very fresh. I loved the wide variety of fish that they added to the paella: mussels, shrimp, squid, clams... every bite had some fish in it. It was good to share between 3 people. The service was also really nice and attentive. Our server made sure to refill our water and also provided recommendations. I am not sure if we made the wrong dish selections, but my impression after one visit is that there are way more authentic Spanish restaurants in the Bay.",
            "BASK WAS DELICIOUS! ARI WAS AMAZING!9pm on a Friday and we had no dinner plans. I chose Bask kind of at random from a yelp search for \"dinner\". Walked in and was seated right away and greeted by Ari with \"Hello friends, can I get you drunk tonight?\"We ordered a couple of drinks and he broke down the menu for us, pointing out his favorite dishes. We ordered the bouquerones, fried brussel sprouts and gambas al ajillo. It was all delicious but the shrimp (gambas al ajillo) were the real stand out. We ended the night with a complimentary aperitif.Ari was fun and sweet and made great recommendations. Will definitely be back next time we're in the city!",
            "Had an amazing time with Sabrina tonight! Incredible experience can't wait to enjoy again!",
            "We had a wedding dinner here for 15 people.  It was very easy to plan and arrange everything with Sabrina.  The food and service was excellent.  Patrick the owner was there that night and was wonderful.  We all had a really good time and every dish was excellent.  I highly recommend the meatballs and churros.  We had calamari, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, paella (yummy), shishito peppers, and Spanish potatoes. The cava and vermouth I had were excellent.  Thank you Bask for making our evening so special.  I only wish I had not forgotten to bring the leftovers home.",
            "This was my first visit to Bask. My bf had made a reservation for Valentine's Day, as expected the whole restaurant was bustling w/ guests but we got seated fairly quickly. Food: We ordered1. Iberico Ham (10/10): This appetizer was absolutely DIVINE. The dish cost around $25 and came w several slices of ham and a delicious sort of bruschetta. My bf and I devoured this in 2 seconds and we were absolutely devastated it was gone so soon. We will be back even if it's just to get this appetizer!! 2. Bone Marrow (5/10): The bone marrow was our least favorite dish of the night, but nonetheless pretty tasty. Bone marrow in general is not a filling dish and this one was only around $15, but we thought that it could've used a little more seasoning. This tapas came with 2 huge pieces of bone marrow and 4 pieces of toasted bread. The bread was a little over toasted. Probably will not get this one again as there are so many other tapas to try! 3. Paella Royale (8/10): The paella royale was pretty scrumptious. It came with some prawns, mussels, clams, calamari, and chicken. All of the seafood and meat were cooked just right. The only down side to this dish was the wait time and the portion size. This dish cost around $35 and we were a little bit disappointed by the small size. We've gotten paella at other Spanish restaurants around the city that cost pretty much the same, but this was by far the smallest portion. To make up for the crazy wait time(50+ minutes), our waitress was sweet enough to give us some wine on the house. All in all my bf and I had an amazing experience at Bask and we will be back!",
            "First time in San Francisco and we chose a place based on Yelp reviews! What a find! This place is great! Perfect atmosphere ... laid back and informal but with great attention to customers by the staff and most importantly delicious food! Sabrina was our bartender and she was great but so was the hostess who greeted us! We ordered the calamari.. light, salty, delicate with a squid ink aioli that was out of this world; the fried chicken came with a sesame seed jalapeño aioli that was the perfection combination of crunchy and tender and an order of Brussels sprouts .. delicious juicy and steaming hot! Followed all this yumminess with a plate of churros for dessert and we couldn't have asked for a better meal! Definitely going to be on our list to visit every time we are in town!",
            "First time visiting this restaurant the other night with my friend. It was fantastic. We enjoyed multiple tapas and all were great. I got some pics, but was so into the food and conversation I missed a few. I didn't get pics of the meatballs or the croquettes, but both were very good. The staff were friendly, but not very attentive (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). It took a few times of awkward glances to get them to approach the table and take our round 2 order and then finally the bill. Still it was a great location, not overly crowded, great food, and nice staff. I'd go back again.",
            "I like the general setting and the vibe they create.  The background music was just right which is to say NOT obnoxiously loud. The service was kinda slow but that worked out because we weren't too hungry or in a hurry.  For tapas this place felt to be a bit on the pricier side - but thats more a function of SF rents.  I thought their selection could be a bit wider but overall no complaints. I'd definitely check this place out again.  Oh and if you don't mind the carbs I really recommend the churros.",
            "Aside from our rough start because of a communication barrier, we were seated and served promptly and ended with some light hearted conversations with our servers. They have countless types of tapas and entrees. And they sell pitchers (~$40) of sangria (red, white, and something else). We ordered the padron peppers, patatas bravas, and corquettes. All were very delicious and reminded me of Spain. The sangria was not as strong but still refreshing (sangria at Picaro is much better). The atmosphere is loud and the place get packed. There is only one unisex bathroom but luckily there wasn't a long wait. There is a full bar with seating and some sit down tables. They also have outdoor seating for parties of 2 at the most. Although not the best and probably more expensive (because of location) than other spanish tapa places, I'd come here again if I didn't feel like going to the Mission for Picaro or Cha Cha Cha.",
            "Disappointing...The food here is quite subpar by any stretch of the imagination. It doesn't keep up with other tapas places in SF and is a far cry from what you can find in Spain. Food tends to be over-cooked. The quality of ingredients is middling. They don't have a full liquor license so the drink selection is very limited...It bums me out to review this place so negatively as the service is incredible. Everyone is so nice and friendly. The ambiance is also great. It just needs better food...",
            "My partner was physically assaulted tonight by one of the owners/managers Patrick all because we asked to have a soggy paella with over cooked meat that we took one bite of removed from our bill. This man injured my fiancé's wrist and ripped buttons off of his shirt and proceeded to insult him by telling him he wasn't of Spanish decent... unbelievable.. Another employee named Sabrina had to step in to diffuse the situation. We made it clear that we didn't want a comped meal we just didn't feel it was right to pay for a terrible paella that we didn't eat. This man is completely unstable... don't eat here the food is terrible and you might walk away with a bruised wrist or a ripped shirt.Patrick will be hearing from our lawyer this week.",
            "What a treat! It was refreshing to understand the menu and what exactly some plates were after having traveled in spain briefly. This little gem of a restaurnt was cozy, friendly, and above all exquisite in food. My boy friend and I shared 6 plates and couldnt decide what was best because all of them were delcious! I will definitely be back and encourage anyone that I know to try this place!",
            "Bask was an absolute delight from start to finish. The ambiance and food offerings as well as the service really hit the mark. Everything I tried was delicious, including their special sangrias. You definitely get bang for your buck when you order a pitcher as it is produces an effective buzz. I particularly enjoyed my seafood paella and foie gras! The flourless chocolate cake was delectable. I highly recommend this restaurant and am looking forward to coming back.",
            "I came here with friends for dinner in search of some great tapas and we weren't disappointed. We ordered a pitcher of red sangria and a spread of dishes- patatas bravas, gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp), bone marrow, serrano ham croquetas, and lamb meatballs. Everything was so delicious but we especially enjoyed the serrano ham croquetas and the delicious sauced it came with. The patatas bravas were perfectly spicy and the bone marrow was decadent and delicious. Service here was really friendly and they didn't make us feel rushed even though it was a busy night for them. They even gave us shots of kiwi liquer at the end of our meal which were surprisingly light. Even FiDi is pretty dead at night, I'd still go out of my way to come here since the food was great. Pop over to Rickhouse after Bask to enjoy a great drink after dinner.",
            "I came here on my birthday with my best friend in town and my husband met us after work.My friend and I arrived early for happy hour, but we were told we had to sit in the \"happy hour area\" in order to get happy hour prices. Even though the restaurant was empty and we had a reservation in the dining area for a short time later. Silly rule. We ordered the happy hour sangria, fried calamari, manchego cheese plate, escargot, seasonal veggies, and black paella dish to share between the 3 of us. The 4 stars is for the food. It was delicious and such a filling, amazing meal. There were some issues with customer service in the beginning, but overall the waiting staff was attentive and friendly so I will give them the benefit of the doubt that hopefully this isn't how they are all the time.Definitely worth it for the food!",
            "We decided to have our post city hall wedding dinner at Bask since we both love tapas and this place has great reviews.We had meatballs, calamari, potatoes bravas, mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, peppers and of course, paella! Everything was delicious!What made the evening even better was the excellent service. Staff and especially the owner, Pat, were attentive and so nice. Thank you for the amazing dinner/evening.Merci Pat!",
            "That's why one of my favorites in the neighborhood. The food is very authentic (coming from a French), the owner is super friendly and the chef will delight you with incredible tapas! Special mention to the paellas and the mushroom tapas!",
            "Food was fantastic.  I'm  so glad we stumbled upon this Basque delight! They even had sidra, although it wasnt as good as Asturian cider, it was really good to have northern Iberian food again.  We ordered WAY too much food because we wanted to try everything and it was all prepared to perfection.  If you want to try northern \"Spanish\" food, I recommend Bask.",
            "A quaint Spanish restaurant serving entree and Tapas. We had a selection of Tapas. The service started out pretty good when the restaurant was not busy but deteriorated rapidly as it got busy to the point we had to ask several times to pay our bill even after we were given it.The food was ok. The octopus was certainly far from fresh. The rest of the meal was not memorable except for the cream brûlée which was quite good."

            "Stubbled upon this gem while sifting through the many breakfast places in the area. It was a pop up in a local bar which I thought was such a cute idea!They rotate their menu and do themed brunches so it's nice to keep it new. But can be a let down if you're looking for something you saw on a review of to try again. They have a craft of mimosas with a variety of juices which is something I looove! I ordered the classic Benedict because I had to get one, it's in the name! They have beer cocktails as well which I also enjoyed. The service is very good. They're all so attentive. Out waitress was super sweet and recommended spots for us to check out as we were just touring the area. It's a cute, quaint little spot. Definitely one of our favorite meals of the weekend.",
            "Cute name, friendly service, and no wait on a Sunday for brunch.  Not the easiest things to achieve in SF!*Shrimply the Best - Good, just not great and not terrible.  My biggest complaint is that the dish was a bit on the room temperature side by the time it arrived at the table.  The shrimps for sure seemed to have been sitting around for a while. For the portion and SF-prices considered, it was probably a little on the overpriced side.  But still definitely worth a try.",
            "This place is a MUST if you are in SF!!!! Eggs benedict is my all time fav breakfast food when I'm out of town so naturally I looked up places on Yelp that served it. Come to find this restaurant which is perfectly named for the exact dish I was looking for! It's like it was meant to be. We called in on a Saturday morning to make reservations. Surprisingly, we were actually able to reserve a table a few hours in advance. And on a weekend! That's a plus. The parking situation was a bit difficult as it is in the city and we had to circle around a few times before finding street parking. There is a pay lot that's right across the street but we didn't opt for that at the time of our visit. The host was very friendly upon my party of 4 entering. He was inviting and got us seated right away (there was no one else waiting to be seated anyway). I was a bit shocked to see that the place wasn't packed. Especially after reading all the great reviews. I expected that they would at least have a few parties waiting for a table. But no, we got a seat right by the front door. Of course I ordered the Classic Benedict. The place is known for their Benedict's and it was what I was craving so there was no other option in mind. I'm happy to say the food was delicious! The hollandaise sauce wasn't too lemon-y like some places make it. It was a pretty good portion for paying $13. I will definitely be back here when I'm visiting SF. They really impressed me with not only their food but also their fast, friendly service as well!",
            "This place was a good find!  We got there pretty late so the restaurant was empty with only 3 other parties dining still.  The server was so sweet and took care of us.Between the 3 of us, we ordered the Benny with Seoul, Banana pecan pancakes and Shrimply the best.  The servings were just right for 1 person, but since I split my meal with fiance, it seemed like it wasn't enough.  The batter on the chicken was perfect and it wasn't dry.  The pancakes were really good too!Definitely a good spot for brunch.",
            "I was searching for a brunch place to come with my friends, and we were intrigued by the name \"friends with benedicts\" that popped up on our yelp search. I thought it was so clever and funny! After checking out the menu, we made a reservation. We were actually running late, but they still had a table for the 5 of us when we arrived, thank goodness, because it was packed! Obviously, the benedicts are the star of the show here, hence the name.Everything we ordered was delicious (aside from the chia pudding), so you can't go wrong with anything I'm about to describe. The 5 of us shared all 5 dishes and ate one at a time. Also, I wanted all the food to come out at the same time to take a picture of it all, but after waiting a few minutes, we just dug into the first 3 plates.Texicano Scramble ($15): pork chorizo, avocado, pico. It says it comes with corn tortillas but we received potatoes?! Anyways, the dish was very tasty, flavorful, and well-seasoned.The Duck Side of the Moon Benedict ($17): I really liked the orange thyme sauce because it added a nice layer of flavor to the duck. It was tender, the english muffin was soft, and the eggs were runny. Perfect! Potatoes were great too!Shrimply the Best Benedict ($17): Good, but the amount of shrimp was skimpy. Banana Pecan Cakes ($12): Yummy! The pancakes were soft, but I feel like there could've been more going on here. The toppings weren't enough to distribute amongst two pancakes to have enough with your bites.Chia Parfait ($8): Bland. Not worth the price. There's some blackberries and raspberries inside, but it's more liquidy than your normal pudding.The service was so-so and SLOW. Our food took 30 minutes to come out, they were out of three of the dishes we were looking forward to (french toast, florentina and crab benedict), and they didn't really check up on us much (water, etc.). BUT, our waitress was kind enough to comp one of the dishes because they didn't have what we wanted to order. We appreciated that.Depending on what you order, it can be pricey (mainly the meaty/seafood dishes).",
            "Phenomenal service from Derrik-yummy bloody bar with killer housemade mix! Food, yum!",
            "We made a reservation online for 1pm, didn't get seated until 1:30pm. What's the point in arriving on time and making online resos if we had to wait alongside among everyone else who did walk-ins?They didn't even apologize, either. We had to forcibly ask them for some sort of concession, and they gave us some comped pancakes. These were pretty good, but we were also starving by then. And then we had to wait another five minutes to ask for utensils and serving plates.The dungeness crab eggs benedict was good. Ask for the hollandaise on the side; otherwise, I find it way too heavy. They gave lots of crab and it paired well with the avocado. The food was pretty good, but the waiting experience (when we had planned ahead) and while we were there, dampened it a little.",
            "There's not a ton of exciting brunch spots in the North Beach area, so when I heard about Friends with Benedicts, I was in. Tucked inside Chief Sullivans, the menu covers some basic breakfast and lunch options.I've come on two separate occasions and had some trouble with the service both times. It's not that they aren't friendly - they're super warm and full of helpful suggestions - but that we've had to wave down a server to take our order each time. I've gotten the roasted duck benedict, which was delicious with the hollandaise but not very strong on the duck flavor. My egg was also slightly overcooked. I've also gotten their burger, which is packed with flavor, but the patty is mighty thin and overcooked. But seriously - all of the flavors are there with just a stumble or two on execution.I hope Friends With Benedicts sticks around. I didn't have to make a reservation, and there was plenty of space. I plan to come again!",
            "Made reservations for Sunday brunch, and glad we did because it was pretty busy around noon. We put our drink orders in almost immediately, but took 20 minutes to get our drinks. Apparently they ran out of clean glasses. Our waitress was really nice and did give us a complimentary carafe if mimosas. Speaking of which, we tried both the watermelon jalapeño and blueberry mint. The watermelon jalapeño was my favorite of the two, although it was difficult to pick up the watermelon flavor there was a kick with the jalapeño. The blueberry mint one was a bit too sweet for me, reminded me of dimetapp and I don't really feel like drinking mimosas that taste like cough syrup during brunch but that may just be me. They do a $20 carafe of flavored mimosas which is a good deal but the carafe isn't as big as you would expect. For food, I obviously had to order a Benny! I got the original one since I'm basic, but added avocado to it (I already explained I'm basic) with extra crispy potatoes. The eggs weren't as runny as I prefer my poached eggs to be, but the hollandaise was good and the potatoes were good. We also got a French toast for the table which was underwhelming. I would give this place a 4, but the slow service and over cooked poached eggs brought it down a star. Can't be 4 stars if you can't execute your namesake dish properly!",
            "The name definitely caught our attention while we were browsing around for a brunch place in The City. It was a little difficult to find at first since it was a pop-up restaurant, but we eventually located it inside of another bar. The idea behind the pop-ups are great since the other businesses don't utilize the space during the day.We made reservations and when we arrived, we were sat down right away. Our server was very helpful and attentive. We were brought our drinks right away. The food took a bit longer since there were other big parties already seated. We did not get to try out the mimosa bar, but it looked very tempting. Something for our next visit for sure.We ordered their Basic Breakfast, Bennie with Seoul and their Salazar benedicts.Bennie with Seoul - The fired chicken was cooked really well and had a lot of flavor. The gochujang sauce and pickled onions went really well with the whole plate. The soju tempura was a little lost in the batter, but everything else was good.Salazar - The flank steak was cooked to a medium rare and had a good flavor to it. The sautéed mushrooms really added a nice flavor and gave the steak a bit more depth.Overall the place was good and the servers were friendly. Once he saw that my daughter was eyeing the whipped cream from another drink, he brought her a shot of whipped cream. The only comment I would have to make is that the place was a bit dirty and the tables were set up kind of haphazardly. You can tell that the place was usually a bar from the way things were set up and how it looked from the inside. Would definitely recommend going here to get some good food if you're in the area.",
            "I made a reservation for brunch for 4 at this place because the reviews were positive. In real life:- 8 out of 8 \"poached\" eggs were overdone - not a single one was runny- The steak was overdone- \"All items on the menu are available\" is actually not a thing. The \"billionaire\" bacon is no longer available. - The Dungeness crab was way too saltyThe reason for not a 1-star is that the people were nice and the cocktails were good.",
            "The food was very good but the service was kind of slow even though they weren't that busy. Also, they did not have that extensive of a menu but everything on it seemed to be quality. If you like themed places, you may enjoy this. This month was Harry Potter themed so all the food was named after characters and they had the movies playing inside. I believe next month is Lord of the Rings. I would highly recommend the build your own Bloody Mary bar for $11 or even a carafe of mimosas for $18. For a Sunday brunch, I feel like that's very reasonable. Be sure to do the Yelp check in for a free cup of coffee!",
            "Horrible service, not really their fault. They are so short staffed it's ridiculous. The food was good so worth two stars. We had to keep asking for help including obtaining a spoon for a pudding. Common sense would be to give a spoon when served? I'll pass next time. Worth a try though.",
            "Was a nightmare trying to find this place and there was only one person on the floor so service was not good at first but then improved. I took one bite and usually get a nice pic of the food for my reviews and I just couldn't stop eating...",
            "Fun little place my friends and I found for breakfast in north Beach.  We had the eggs Benedict , I had the Seoul Benedict- such a surprise and so good !!   We each had a carafe of different types of mimosa.  I loved the blood orange version- so yummy.  Servers and staff were great would definitely come back to this place !",
            "THEY HAVE A HARRY POTTER MENU!!!Yes, it's not terribly themed, and the food does end up coming out looking like a lot of other brunch places, but the idea of having Hogwarts House-themed menus in themselves is pretty cool.Overall, I thought the food was fine, the pop-up location was decent (better than the other location where it was in a bar - that one smelled like vomit!), and I enjoyed the nice day in San Francisco being able to sit and eat outside.I get a little confused as to what is considered a \"pop-up\" nowadays - I feel like the term is getting bent into different directions as time goes on. But hey! Back on topic - check out the food! I found it tasty enough.Just one tip - if you go, make sure to specify the location and address, as you might end up in the wrong place as I did!",
            "Food was fine but nothing stood out.Service was VERY slow - they only have two waitresses serving 20+ tables. The waitresses were friendly but it took a total of 2+ hours from arriving there to leaving (for two people). They were even slow to pick up the check..?The ambiance is cozy and casual and the Christmas decorations were gorgeous!",
            "Awesome concept! They definitely live up to their name. We had the tempura Benedict and the steak tip one and both were scrumptious! The chef was also very helpful by going over their menu to us tableside.",
            "Decent brunch place with last minute reservations for a large party? I'm in!We were trying to find resos for a party of 6 last min on a Saturday night, and I ran across the Friends with Benedicts popups that are in several places. Thought it'd be worth a try - and it was indeed! It wasn't too busy since it's located in a pub, but even though most of our party showed up late, and then switched from the inside to the outside, the server was very accommodating and nice. Service was a little bit slow, but I chalk that up to us sitting all the way on the outside edge. The potatoes that came with my benedict were super delicious and perfectly crispy, the benedict itself was good. I'd pass on the french toast next time, but everyone generally liked their dishes. I think overall I'd rate this more of a 3.5 but will round up because it is definitely a reliable decent place.",
            "Found this \"pop-up\" breakfast spot while visiting SF and staying in Chinatown - our server, Chris, was amazing! Hats off to the chef as well - food was great, hot, well-prepared and nicely presented - This concept is great - utilize the kitchen at bars/pubs that do not open regularly for breakfast, give diners a tasty meal and cocktails (I mean seriously - Bloody Marys, Mimosas, screwdrivers ... what day isn't made better with delish libations ... LOL).Located just a 10 minute walk from the Royal Pacific Motel in the heart of Chinatown, we really enjoyed the service by our working comedian/waiter.Seating inside and outside of this fascinating Irish pub that was originally a fire station more than 100 years ago, reasonably priced food and funny servers? Can't beat that for a weekend breakfast!Just wished Chris said something funny ... LOL - he was a good server and very informative - Check it out!"

            "My mouth is watering thinking of this place! It's the best! Menu is extremely versatile catering to different taste palates & different cravings. They have different seating areas such as overlooking the beach, on the patio overlooking the pier or inside. The bar service was fast and they don't skimp you on their drinks. The drinks are fairly priced averaging 10 dollars. Their Bloody Mary comes with a large shrimp, celery, & olives. It was one of the best bloody Mary's I've had.For their appetizer, we had their mussels which come with a coconut curry sauce. This combination was heaven in my mouth and was my favorite thing that I tried.My boyfriend got the seafood platter which had shrimp, calamari, fish, fries & coleslaw. Size was good and fills you up.I tried the crab and shrimp roll sandwich which was very refreshing.Tip: they validate parkingEnjoy!",
            "Eat here!I stopped in here while in SF for business. I came prepared to order a lobster roll, but couldn't resist a crab cake, glass of local wine, and a crab Louie salad. Highly recommended by the bartender. All of my food was simply amazing and perfect! The servers and staff here were very happy, playful, on point, and a pleasure to be around. When I see happy staff, I know they must have a great management team! I sat at the end of the bar(alone) but I never felt alone with these happy folks all around. There was a beautiful bay/ocean/bridge view. The crab cake was the best I've ever had. Perfect crunch, moist, delicious. The salad was huge and totally shareable. Very generous serving of perfect crab, and vegetables. Would certainly come back with the family",
            "We came here on two separate occasions on two separate days. The first time was a late night oyster and champagne run at the front bar. I feel bad for forgetting his name but there was a husky, Hispanic bartender with curly hair pulled back into a shirt pony tail who served us.  HE WAS GREAT! He up-sold us on some champagne but was so genuine and tactful that it didn't bother me at all. In fact, when we saw him at another establishment the day after, we bought him a beer. That was the first day...The second trip was completely different.  Our server was somewhat impatient and not very accommodating.  As always, we ordered oysters and champagne.  Both were par for the course so no complaints.  We also ordered garlic fries, chowder and \"Maine\" lobster tails.  The chowder was decent, not really great and not really awful.  The garlic fries were mostly garlic and whatever else makes them garlic fries with not all that much \"fries\".  They were kind of tough to eat because the garlic was so overpowering.  The lobster tails were literally the smallest I've personally ever eaten in my life. Being from the North Atlantic where these lobsters come from, I guess I'm used to a standard size when served in a restaurant but that just isn't the case here.  Beyond that, they were prepared decently well, but for the price and quality, this is not something I'd ever order again here.  The kicker for me was when the server asked me how everything was, I told her, \"Just ok. Not good not bad.\"  She was not pleased with my response and simply walked away.  For me, that was enough to leave here a tip that reflected her effort and hospitality.  All in all, the place isn't BAD.  I'd probably just order a burger or fish and chips if I ever went back.Food: 7/10Drink: 7/10Service: 5/10",
            "Our group had tickets for Alcatraz and had only 45 minutes to order and eat for a group of 14 people and Pier Market was able to get us in and out. I got the burger with crab (special) and a bowl of clam chowder. My burger was nothing special. I definitely feel like I paid too much but given the location of this restaurant, as expected. The clam chowder was good and even better with the free sour dough rolls. Our bill needed correction but it can happen with a group of 14. If you're at the Pier and wanted a sit down meal at your convenience, this restaurant would work for you.",
            "This place is located on the coolest pier in the city in my opinion. There is seal watching, activities, views, shops and places to get some good food and drinks. We ended up stopping here for lunch one day.The view from inside of the restaurant is quite amazing. You can see the bay clearly with all the wonderful sail boats and other boats parked in their slips right outside the back window wall. There really isn't a bad seat in the house. We ordered the calamari with the sauce it is tossed in on the side. It was DELISH! The calamari was fresh, but the dipping sauce was by far the star of the show. It was house made and unlike anything we have had before. FULL of flavor and textures. The chowder here is amazing. It has bits of bacon in it so it really compliments the clams. It was piping hot and creamy. Just what we were looking for.  We also had the clam appetizer. They were amazing. Large and plump. NOT dry. Not overcooked and the sauce was amazing. It was a buttery lemon garlic sauce and none of us could get enough! I ordered the Caesar salad with crab meat on top. There was no shortage of crab, that's for sure. This dish was awesome! I suggest stopping here for some views and nice seafood!",
            "We arrived just as they opened. There was a small line, but we were seated quickly right by the window. We had a fantastic view of the city in one direction and Alcatraz in the other. Couldn't ask for more.Our waiter was extraordinarily friendly and patient. He never rushed us. As Bloody Marys were ordered, he asked if they would be interested in an extra shot for $2. That seemed like a deal, so all those drinking Bloody Marys upgraded. They were huge. I was lucky enough to get a sip and it was delicious. Nice and spicy, with one shrimp and two olives. I ordered a beer.I started off with a cup of clam chowder. It was as good as the other reviewers have stated. Lots of clams and a hint of bacon. A cup was just enough, although I could have eaten a few bowls of it!I ordered the Salmon Salad - mixed greens, tomatoes and onions tossed with house vinaigrette topped with a filet of fresh grilled salmon and a drizzle of creamy herb dressing. It was really very good. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was tender and flaked nicely. The flavor and the vinaigrette and herb dressing mixed well with the fish. The salad filled the plate, so it was a bit difficult to eat without having the greens jump off the plate onto the table. Still, it was excellent.Everyone else enjoyed all the food. I heard the Jambalaya was fantastic. The fish and chips was good and the crab cocktail and crab cakes were delicious. Nobody left anything on their plates.Prices were a little high, but that's to be expected in San Francisco and especially at a place highly traveled by tourists.I get a kick out of Pier 39, particularly before it gets crowded. Pier Market Seafood Restaurant is a great choice for good food, pleasant service and a great view.",
            "I stopped at Pier Market twice on a trip to San Francisco - one to the quick service stand outside to grab lunch, and a second time to sit down for lunch in the restaurant. Both experiences were good, and I would recommend Pier Market as a good lunch option on Pier 39.Although the restaurant caters to tourists, the quality of the food is still very good. Everything was fresh and delicious. I chose the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl from the stand - the wait was extremely short, the chowder was delicious and full of goodies, not too broth-heavy. The sourdough bread was really good - I think they use Boudin's, which is also located on Pier 39For our sit-down lunch, we had a great view of the harbor. I made a reservation through Yelp which was extremely helpful, and we were able to get in and out  in about an hour - no small feat as the place was packed for Sunday afternoon lunch. Our server Vickee was pleasant and although she was very busy she seemed to pick up that we were on a tight schedule and was very helpful in accommodating us. We really appreciated this. Lunch started with a California craft brew and a tasty Bloody Mary with solid garnishes, especially the large shrimp included. They serve the same sourdough bread as the bread bowl (in a small loaf) to start which is nice. We ordered right away and everything came out within maybe 15-20 minutes - a half dozen oysters, the fisherman's platter (which they kindly split for us on two plates to share unprompted), and a full order of steamed clams. Everything was fresh and delicious, right down to the tartar sauce. We especially enjoyed the calamari in the fisherman's catch and the steamed clams. Save some fries or some of the sourdough to dip in the delicious garlic butter herb broth! I would definitely recommend Pier Market for a quick stop or a leisurely lunch option while exploring Pier 39. The atmosphere is great and the prices match the quality and portion sizes of the food. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation for through the Yelp app!",
            "Yummy in my tummy! Came here on a Sunday because we were in the area. Walked up and had about a 20 minute wait. We got seated near a big window which was ocean view however you are looking at all the people walking by and the seals and boats. I ordered a pomegranate margarita and it was delicious. Also ordered the garlic dungeon crab and OMG so yummy! It came with a side of rice which I wasn't crazy about so I actually didn't eat it. But the crab, that was good. The do provide a bib and wipes, yea you will get messy. Our waiter was nice and always checked on us which I appreciate wherever I go. Also ordered the tiramisu and it was melt in your mouth delicious. Keep in mind with two meals, two drinks and a dessert the tab was pricey but I say worth it.",
            "As much as this place can be a tourist trap since it is located in the heart of Pier 39, I absolutely am a fan! Their steamed clams here are phenomenal - full of garlic flavor, plump, and perfect for dipping with the complimentary sourdough bread that you get (we always end up eating 2-3 baskets of this bread!!). The cioppino was also superb, they sure do not skimp on the seafood and there's also linguine underneath for you carb lovers. Clam chowder was creamy, I don't think it had enough clams inside, but still tasty otherwise. If you are lucky and get a seat at the bar, befriend the bartender! She makes very tasty drinks and is super friendly!",
            "I was staying in town and staying near Fisherman's wharf.  I have visited this restaurant a few times , but never gave them a review. Almost every time I'm there I order their cioppino and it has always been delicious. This visit was no exception.Almost any night of the week the that I have been here the restaurant has a steady stream of customers, but I've never had to wait too long for a table. The staff is always friendly and eager to please. And once again, this trip was no exception.There are a lot of great restaurants in the area, but Pier Market always provides a consistent experience at a reasonable price.",
            "Visited this place for lunch last weekend. Had clam chowder in a sourdough bowl, seafood mixed platter, and grilled cheese sandwich for kids. The food was served quick, the food was fresh and tasty. For location the price was reasonable. The quantity was good. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the service. Once we got seated and order was taken there was no checkin from the service staff. Had to wait to get his attention for condiments meanwhile the food was getting cold. It was a bit of a wait, I am not a picky person and understand they are attending multiple tables. However there were few times when he walked around our table and I was trying to get his attention to not munch success . Bottom line food was good, price good, location great. Will visit this place again",
            "Hands down the best Salmon I have ever had!!! This restaurant is a must when in San Francisco, not only can you get a nice view of the seals you get fresh food and good service. The restaurant was busy but we did not have to wait for long. The good thing is if there is a long wait you can always go and see the shops or the seals while you wait to be seated. Tried the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl for the first time and it was good, but I would not order it. however, my friends really enjoyed it an stated that they would definitely order it again. My husband ordered the blackened Pacific Rock Cod he liked it BUT preferred my plate. In which I had to continue fighting with his fork to avoid him finishing my salmon. Next time we are in San Francico we are cominf back for the salmon this time my husband gets a plate of his own. Price range is a bit pricy, but worth the food.",
            "This here is a good stop if you're hitting all the tourist spots in SF. It's got seafood, clam chowder, sourdough, and so on and so forth. With that being said, there are much better seafood restaurants out there but you'll have to leave this area.Tourist trap aside though, they serve up decent food at expensive prices. Clam chowder is a nice appetizer and any of the entrees do the job. You can make reservations or walk in if it's not too busy. So yeah, if you are at Fisherman's Wharf or Pier 39, you could enjoy this place as best as you can.",
            "The food here got me VIOLENTLY ILL!! My husband and I went to the 7D museum on Monday and decided to hang out in the area for the day. We were starving and with so many options to choose from, unfortunately we chose Pier Market. I hadn't eaten anything else that day and had felt fine in the morning, so I know for a fact something I ate here was the culprit.Service was good and our waiter was pretty attentive. My husband got the fish and shrimp sandwich while I got the grilled salmon burger. We both got the clam chowder. He opted for water and I got their homemade lemonade.My clam chowder had undercooked potatoes, so after eating one of the questionable pieces, I stopped eating the potatoes all together. The taste was decent. Not mind blowing, but decent. My salmon burger wasn't cooked long enough in my opinion. I started to feel a little nauseous after my meal, but thought it would wear off. Boy was I WRONG!! Either the clam chowder or my salmon burger was off, but I'm more inclined to think it was the salmon because my husband also at the clam chowder and he didn't get sick. Or perhaps the \"homemade lemonade\" was made with unfiltered water that wasn't the cleanest. I didn't eat any food after visiting this place.I opted to skip dinner because I was scared to eat. First it started with stomach convulsions followed by the runs ALL NIGHT LONG. I mean it was BADDDDD. Then, it climaxed into projectile vomiting, all over the hotel bathroom floor and I felt lightheaded and had to clean up this big mess afterwards. It took throwing up for me to feel some relief. I will NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER come back to this place again, even if they paid me! This ruined one day out of our vacation!",
            "Went here on a Tuesday evening to celebrate my sister's birthday.  She had requested to eat here because she had a great experience prior.  The restaurant is on Pier 39 somewhat in the middle.  It is a good size with great views if you sit by the windows.  As there were 12 of us they only had room up front near the entrance.  The restaurant was clean and our server was good.  I did have a mishap but it was taken care of quickly and with good taste.There were a lot of dishes ordered and I think the prices for the food was decent because the seafood was so fresh.  They also accomodate the meat eating people.  Here is what we had on the menu:Fried Calamari: House breaded and served with cocktail sauce - the calamari were thick, more seafood than bread, but the breading was also delish with sesame seeds on them.  I didn't even use the cocktail sauceScallop Penne with pesto sauce:  this was a special that day, the scallops were succulent and a good size, the penne cooked well and the pesto was amazing.  It also had veggies in it so nothing was overwhelming.Salmon Quesadilla:  Just as it says, a quesadilla with salmon and roasted peppers,  and cilantro lime cream on top.  It sounds weird but it actually was surprisingly good an the cream really compliments it.Jambalaya: Smoked pork, clams, mussels, shrimp, and chicken simmered in a Creole sauce and served over Cajun rice - out of all the dishes, this was not that good.  The rice was not cooked well, especially for the entree.  It was too hard and well, the rice makes everything in jambalaya.  Steamed Mussels: Onions & peppers in a red curry coconut broth - this was really good.  The flavor seeped into the mussels and the sauce was so good, I had to keep asking for bread for dipping.Clam Chowder in a Sourdough Bowl:  as alwyas, you cannot go wrong with clam chowder in the city.  This clam chowder had bacon so it was a big plus for me!BBQ Pork Ribs: House smoked baby back pork ribs then finished on a mesquite grill, served with 2 sides:  the meat was tender, fall off the bone, and juicy.  The flavor....YUM!Garlic Roasted Whole Dungeness Crab: Served with rice or garlic buttered potatoes - this was my meal...the crab was sweet and the garlic topping they had went perfect with it.  What I ended up doing was adding the garling topping to the butter and a little lemon, came out as perfection.  This is the meal that I had a problem with though.  My side was never brought out.  They ended up fixing it for me so I was happy with the outcome.Lobster Tails with 1/2 crab: Two 4-5 oz. Maine lobster tails served with drawn butter and a side of crab - they were all cooked perfectly, no chewyness, just melt in your mouth deliciousness.Warm Chocolate Fudge Cake: Warm chocolate cake with a richchocolate center served with vanilla ice cream - this was so rich and served hot, perfect with the cold ice cream.  My sister's free cake for her birthday.  I love it, if you are a chocolate fiend, then this is for you.So that about sums it up.  I would definitely come back, even though the jambalaya was not great, the rest was amazing.  I would recommend you try it out too.",
            "Comfortable spot located on Pier 39, reservations recommended during business hours or weekends. My visit was quaint our server , Chad great attitude, friendly and attentive. Service wait was minimal for us, utilized Yelps new waitlist. Mind you very awesome. Seated for 2, food order taken quick and return time for food, served nice and tasteful. Location is nice, if your available to get a window of ocean view or front patrons enjoying the Pier. Recommended a thumbs up.",
            "Came here with coworkers after taking the Segway tour. I like this place. Good ambience and location overlooking the pier, can't beat that. Good food, good service. I had to get the chowder in bread bowl, it was very fresh and tasty - chowder ingredients and bread bowl freshly baked. Ordered a few entrees and appetizers all were delicious. Would come again.",
            "Delicious! Everything was delicious and beautifully served! The location is perfect with amazing views! We enjoyed a drink at the bar with two very friendly bartenders (didn't get names, male and female, both blonde) while we were waiting for our table and they were very kind and offered great tips. Then were seated by the window with a stunning view and enjoyed a delicious dinner. Our server, Dolly, was extremely kind, accommodating and offered great tips for the area. We will definitely be back again!",
            "Stopped by here after our visit to Alcatraz Island.  We ordered the sweet and sour Calamari and I honestly think it was the best Calamari that I have ever tried.  I would highly Recommend that for your appetizer.  We also ordered the Clam chowder in the sourdough bowl since this is the thing to get in San Francisco.  It was also very good, not super creamy and very freshly made. The place was busy so the service was on the slower side but food over ruled service.",
            "Oh man definitely put yourself on the waitlist or make reservations! This place is ridiculously busy! We tried the crabcake and garlic sourdough. The crabcakes were delicious, I could've had it as an entree too! The garlic sourdough was good, but there's a limit to how much sourdough I can have. It's a big helping! I had the trout, which I loved! It was a big plate! I got it with veggies and potatoes. The sides are great, they all have a smoked flavor! Delicious!Hubby had the Pier Market mixed grill, which he really liked. Mum had the shrimp combo. I tried the fried ones and the scampi. The scampi could've done with more sauce but were pretty good none the less! She also got the coleslaw as a side which I couldn't get enough of! I would definitely come here again!"

            "Damn good fish & chips. I was on a fish & chips kick for awhile and Codmother satisfied these cravings every time. Crispy batter; thick, salty fries. Drown it all in that malt vinegar! Who cares if it's touristy? This place is bomb.Parking is scarce if you choose to drive in due to its location in Fisherman's Wharf. Might want to walk (or waddle, depending on how much you ate) after your meal :)",
            "While the customer service was stellar and friendly, the food was just decent. Hubby had the fish and chips, kids had the shrimp, and I had the tacos. Stick to the fish and chips. The fish did not taste like fish and fries were thick cut. Perhaps our expectations are high (we have had fish and chips in Alaska). But overall it was a decent place to have lunch. Family friendly albeit with limited seating and limited parking.",
            "I am a local. I work about 4 blocks away and have eaten at The Codmother many times.Wonderful place to have authentic fish and chips. Here's why:1. Owner is very friendly and welcoming to everyone, locals and tourists.2. Great value. You WILL be satisfied with a regular fish & chips, shrimp & chips or combo.3. Every utensil is recyclable. This is a VERY responsible SF establishment.4. Everything is made fresh. You may need to wait a few minutes, especially when they're busy, but it's worth the wait. The quality is OUTSTANDING and it's ALWAYS fresh.5.It's all outside, but there's plenty of seating. There are some large tables, so be prepared to make some new friends. I personally love that environment.Kudos to a well run business with excellent food at good prices and with friendly owners/staff. A rarity in the Bay Area these days.",
            "Drove way out of my way to try this place after seeing the reviews on Yelp.  This is definitely a must if you ever are in the area. Best fish and chips I have ever had and the portions are huge!  Was worth the drive, the awful navigating around the wharf, and the crazy parking situation.  Just do it.  One of the tastiest, best decisions I made my last week spent in Northern California. Next time I'm in this area I will be back for sure.  Although I might hire an Uber next time.",
            "I saw this on the yelp 100 list a couple of years ago so it inspired me to try it.  I don't usually eat fish and chips and if I do, it's usually pretty terrible quality.  The fish and chips here was pretty good though.  I did enjoy it at first, but after a while it was way too heavy and I felt pretty disgusting after.  It did taste good tho.",
            "Had such high hope for this place. I even brought a friend that's visiting SF to here. What a disappointment, the fish didn't taste like anything, the batter is nothing to write home about, the fries were whatever also.Pro tip: for amazing fish and chips, go to the Pier 23 Cafe on the Embarcadero.",
            "Food is exceptional. The seating is limited but moves quickly. I ordered fish and chips, shrimp and chips, and the loaded French fries. Everything was really tasty and fast.",
            "I don't care what anybody says. This little food station Down By The Wharf puts out the best fish and chips I've had in the 10 years I've been in Bay Area. The staff owner is a lovely British woman who is dependable, sweet and knows her way around a beer batter. Their fish tacos are amazing as well so make sure when you visit SF to give them a try!!",
            "This girl loves Fish and Chips and I knew I had to try this place out when I found out I'd have to fly to SF for a work trip.  They're located at Fisherman's Wharf across the street (diagonally) from Surisan and really easy to find.  Just be on the lookout for that 'golden gate' and you'll be in the right place.Their menu is small - fish n' chips, fish/shrimp tacos, fries, fried oreos, & drinks.  You can get a combo fish n chips (shrimp/fish) or just the fish only.  I went with the classic fish and chips, of course!I picked out my table (there's a handful of them) and waited just a short while before my order was ready.  Fresh hot fish and chips were such a welcomed treat in the chilly San Francisco weather.  The fish portion was a good size and was served with an ample amount of fries.  I doused those babies in malt vinegar and dug in. The fish was moist and the batter was nice and crispy.  Yum!  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and it fueled me up for the rest of my day of solo sight seeing around SF.Overall, pretty tasty.  Not the best fish and chips I've ever had, but still a great version of one of my favorite dishes.  4 stars because my 2nd visit a few months later wasn't as great as my first.  It lacked a bit of flavor and I needed to add more salt to get that extra oomph.  Otherwise, still a solid spot to check out while in the city!",
            "My boyfriend and I were looking for affordable and delicious food while walking around the pier, and of course...everything was over priced. But literally a 3-5 minute walk away from the pier, we found this gem! For some reason we were expecting an actual restaurant, but it was a big trailer with picnic tables! We were hesitant at first but this place received many good reviews so...had to give it a try. S E R V I C E:You simply order and find yourself a table while you site. We only waited for 10-15 minutes!F O O D:We ordered their Baja fish tacos and garlic fries. Their garlic fries were perfect - thick cut fries, crispy, and the perfect amount of garlic, salt, and parsley. Each order of Baja tacos comes with two tacos, and at first I thought it would be enough, but it was very filling. The sauce was tangy with a bit of a kick to it, and the fish had the perfect amount of batter around it! O V E R A L L:You save money, and the food is great. What more can you ask for? I don't know what they do with the location when it rains, but today was a beautiful day, it was perfection eating outside. Can't wait to try their fish and chips next time!",
            "This little truck with outdoor seating has the best fish and chips I have ever tried. The owners are British and they are so kind and nice! We ordered the combo ( fish + shrimp ) with chips and devoured it within minutes. The shrimp is very juicy. I'm usually not really a fan of thick fries like theirs but they somehow get them just right!!",
            "I was sure that this place must have been the BEST place to get fish and chips in SF due to its abundance of ratings. It might have been due to my high expectations that this place was a little disappointing. The permanent food truck stand is located maybe a block away from the hustle and bustle of Fisherman's wharf. The area is small with only outdoor seating provided, but this was a good thing for us, we had our little dog with us!   My boyfriend and I shared the the fish and chips. The batter was very crispy, it had a good texture. It was actually my favorite part! However, it could have used a little more flavor, it was a little bland. The fries were just fries. Overall, we were glad that we shared so that we still had room to eat somewhere else.",
            "My oh my, Codmother is literally the mother of all fish and chips Food Trucks! There is always a line, due to the limited seating but I promise the line moves fast and you won't regret waiting. My friends and I wanted to try everything, so we had their fish, shrimp and chips - everything was so wonderfully delicious and fresh. The guys working the food truck are super nice and super quick. Next time you're in the mood for fried goodness, Codmother is your spot!",
            "This place is legit. I came here after getting a much needed massage. I tried the fish tacos and garlic fries. This lady has her routine down like no other. I like it. Fish wasn't overly greasy or heavily battered. Just the right amount of slaw in the tacos and really well cooked piece of fish. Their garlic fries are on another level. Thick crunchy and potatoey. We are the whole thing, but said we would stop after eating half of it... Haha.",
            "The (cod)Mother of all fish fillets!When you find an eatery in a tourist area where you see more locals than tourists - GO THERE!!! We found the Codmother online while vacationing in San Francisco. When we arrived, were surprised that it's an outdoor location! Being a little rainy, we wondered, \"Is this worth it?\" The answer is a resounding YES! You order at a window, choices include a fish or shrimp combo with fries or fish only. You hang out under a canopy at a picnic table and when your lucky number is called, magic happens! The fish fillets are large, puts any fish chain to shame. And so flavorful; I forgot to ask what type of fish they use but they were flaky and great with malt vinegar. Hubby got the shrimp combo; shrimp were larger than a silver dollar and a light batter that made it taste great and crispy.While we were there, we saw half dozen folks that were waited on. Since the owner of Codmother chats with every customer, we learned their backgrounds; only one was a tourist from out of state - the others were a local transit worker, a maid at a nearby hotel, guys that were doing construction next door, a nail tech that lives nearby, and a group of adult students that LOVE the shrimp. With those odds, I'll support LOCAL anytime we come into town!",
            "I am super picky with fish and chips but this place hit the spot! My belly and my taste buds were completely satisfied. Fish was fresh, batter and crunch on par! Fries were hot with fresh garlic, had to get garlic fries, paid extra and didn't regret it for a minute. Only issue is I shared my meals d I could of easily had a meal to myself, so get your own and don't share!!",
            "I was praying that this place was still around. First ate here several years ago and have been wanting to go back. Yes, it was that memorable. Menu is straightforward. Their fish is so fresh and perfectly fried. Can't stop thinking about that first bite, that crunch. This place is a must if you're visiting the area.",
            "Great service, excellent food, fun atmosphere! If you want fish and chips this is the only place to go! Shrimp is also delicious! Wish they had a food truck in Austin TX!",
            "If you're in the Fisherman's Wharf area and are craving some decently priced seafood, I definitely recommend coming to this little \"food truck.\" I put this in quotations because when I arrived, I realized many food trucks have taken permanent residence in this area and have created outdoor seating areas in front of their permanently parked vehicles. Seating wise, there aren't that many tables -- no more than 10, but when I went on a Sunday afternoon I had no problem grabbing a little table for two. I had ordered Fish & Chips -- two fried fillets with fries for about $12. I wasn't the biggest fan of the batter - it was very heavy and quite oily from the frying, so at some point I started just digging the fish out from inside and eating it plain. But besides that, the fish was certainly amazing. It was so moist and it tasted pretty fresh as well. I think for the price and the amount provided, my dish was pretty worth it! Overall, I had a pleasant experience at this little food truck. I'm not sure if I would necessarily come back because there are so many food places to try throughout the Wharf, but it isn't bad and is definitely worth a try!",
            "The Codmother is located on the north side of Beach near the north east corner of Beach and Jones.  It's been just over 4 years since my last visit to the Codmother Fish and Chips and to this day my nephew who is now 12 has fond memories of this business and their food.  This place is a fenced off trailer with some picnic tables and the ability to serve tourists in a tourist area with amazing fish and chips for a very reasonable price considering where they are located.  If you go up and down Jefferson to all the sit down restaurants in the area you'll notice that most of them serve fish and chips and they are all for the most part charging about 20 bucks.  This is not to say that the other offerings are a rip off or what they have is worse.  I'm not claiming that because really I haven't been to all those places and tried theirs but really the Codmother's fish and chips is just so good it's amazing that after 4 years so little has changed.There are some changes however because you'd have to think after that much time that some things could have changed.  I did notice that the long strips of cod do seem a bit smaller than in my last review but that's not to say that it wasn't filling.  The normal serving is still 2 pieces of fish by the way.  The cost is no longer 10 dollars but has escalated to 13 now.  13 bucks for this serving of 2 pieces of fish and chips is still a deal considering fish is not cheap and the price of cod hasn't really dropped over 4 years either.  Fresh, hot, delicious and amazing value.  This is the simplest way for me to describe this place which is essentially no frills, no nonsense and just good plain food.  I was lucky to order and be served before closing.  When it's closing time they sort of close the gate of the fence so customers will get the hint but still I saw some come in after that while some were served and other were turned away probably because the fryers were turned off at that point.Amazing food in a place where you'd probably expect to be gouged or priced in as a tourist but no, the value and quality still holds true after 4 years.Keep up the great work and never leave!"

            "You will not be disappointed coming here. Came on a Sat afternoon at 430 and waited about 15 mins for an outside table after visiting the hostess. Little did I know that it was first come, first serve outside, so don't waste your time like I did. Grab a chair while you can. They serve complimentary bread and leave a pitcher of water on the table. No frills, which I actually prefer anyway. Inside is quaint and harder to get a table. We had the clam chowder, risotto & shrimp and scallops mixture. They were all divine! So good. The risotto was hands down the best I've had in the city (best ever being in beautiful Venizia), seafood was very fresh. This is my new favorite place for all things seafood. Didn't try the cioppino but will next time!",
            "Be prepared to wait!! We arrived around 7pm on a Saturday (probably dinner rush) and was told that the wait would be around an hour 20 minutes for two. They ran out of pagers so they told us to just come back in an hour to get seated. We went next door to Pete's to grab a drink while we waited and went back to check-in again an hour 15 minutes later. We were then told that it'll be another 20 minutes. After 20 minutes went by, we were told it will be another 15. At that point we had already waited for 2 hours and the food just wasn't worth the wait. We ended up just asking to sit outside since the tables were unoccupied and everyone else seemed to be waiting for a table inside. We ordered the cioppino, crab diavolo, and 4 oysters (2 west coast, 2 east coast) and 2 raw clams. The oysters and clams were fresh but on the smaller side, comes with a marinara type sauce. The cioppino was a big portion, but I wouldn't call it \"The Best Damn Cioppino in SF\". There was a lot of seafood no doubt, but the soup itself was quite bland and I didn't like all the penne pasta that was included. The crab diavolo (half order of crab over linguine) was okay, the crab was delicious but the pasta was dripping in oil. We ended up dipping some of our bread in the oil which turned out pretty yummy. Overall, I don't think the food was justified by the amount of time we waited. If you visit, I suggest coming with a group of 3 or more so you can make a reservation beforehand.",
            "The good, the bad and the ugly. Good-Seafood for the most part. Wait staff is top notch. Bad- No creativity in their dishes. Example- all the pasta dishes are plain-Jane. Pasta with heavy cream based butter sauce. Not much garlic, and too thick. Pesto was an overdose and needed a little thought by the chef. The chef needs to taste all the pasta sauces and they'll find that they need to add something to break the heavy buttercream sauce even cherry tomatoes in the pesto would've been perfect for that dish. My fettuccine with the scallops was basically as simple as it sounds. My wife's seafood fettuccine was bland.The UGLY-THE WAIT, EVEN WITH RESERVATIONS.The lack of ventilation. Has to be very unhealthy for everyone. My Daughters couldn't eat because they got over-heated. Super UGLY- Red wine served WARM! What? Yes served warm. Plus my glass was not washed and absolutely gross. Crusty all over the rim and base. They didn't charge me and I appreciated it. Thank you. Advice-We should've taken the hint from the Uber driver when he mentioned that we should eat seafood out of town and not at a tourist destination. We will listen next time.",
            "Busy and fun place to grab some  seafood and pasta. Feels like i'm back on the coast of Italy! The steamers combo is my choice, the broth was soooooo awesome!! The cold fresh raw oysters mmmm I want more just writing this! Staff was so friendly and professional they know what they are doing and do it well!Molte grazie!",
            "If I could rate just the food itself I would give them a 5/5. However the service here was HORRIBLE. I've never experienced such bad customer service in my whole life. First, they seated us downstairs when there were clearly several seats available upstairs. The downstairs area is murky and smells of the fish market. However, we decided to just be seated there and not give them a hard time. We ordered half a dozen of oysters and the cioppino to share. The oysters took around an hour to be delivered to us and the ice that they were sitting on was all melted. It was obvious that they were sitting out for quite a long time. They were fresh and the cioppino was delicious. However the waitress NEVER walked by us and it took another 20 minutes for us to ask the waiter for the check when we were done eating. We had to wait yet again for her to bring us change. We spent SO much time waiting after we finished eating. IF you ever come here get a seat upstairs.",
            "OMG!!!!!!! Now that I have your attention, I want to let you know that I have been waiting to write this review for a while. I went to San Fran a month ago on a business trip and ate out at a different place 3x a day for a week. That's a lot of restaurants. But this.... THIS was the experience and food that I CAME here for. That I will NEVER forget. Let's begin. I took a bike taxi to my hotel one night in the Wharf because we were so tired of walking. The kind gentlemen chatted with us and we found out he has been living here in San Fran for 20 years. When he dropped us off, I remembered that I HAD to try the best Ciopinno in San Fran before we left and I asked for the best place to go. He said Sotto Mare and I was determined to come here. The next day, we ubered to this place and were seated at the bar where there is an open view to the food being cooked. I am so glad this is where we were sat because it directly impacted my review. You literally watch every step to the food being crafted and served. It was incredible watching the different steps to the Ciopinno. The clams, the shrimp, the crab being hammered in front of you... the sauce.. The garlic... It was incredible. So you can say the ambiance here is wonderful. When we got our Ciopinno, I could feel my heart skip a beat. It was LARGE. It was served in a giant ceramic bowl. It was visually pleasing in EVERY aspect of the word. You can see the clams, the shrimp, the mussels, the crab and bits of penne pasta peaking out of piping hot tomato broth. The seafood was perfect. It was cooked to perfection. The pasta was cooked to perfection. The sauce was incredible and FULL of the Ciopinno flavor you crave. I could not get enough. I could eat this every day for the rest of my life. It is served with a giant ladle which I assume is for sharing, but my lovely friend and I just dug our hands in and went to town. There was no way we could finish it. Oh the clams. I almost forgot to tell you! THEY'RE HUGE! Some of the largest I have ever had. They're plump and delicious when sucked out of the shell with the red sauce. This was a dream come true. In closing, GO HERE. Get the Ciopinno and thank me later. PEACE!",
            "This little, almost hole-in-the-wall eatery has some of the best reviews in the city, so we HAD to try it. We showed up for a late lunch around 2:30 and the place was rocking! Not packed wall to wall, but certainly busy and people seemed genuinely happy to be eating there.  We sat at the bar and ordered a couple of Peronis.  The patrons on both sides of us recommended the Cioppino but we walked in with an agenda.  We started with a couple oysters, 2 East Coast and 2 West Coast.  We weren't sure exactly where they were from but the ECs definitely tasted like NORTH Atlantic.  They were ice cold and super fresh. Can't beat fresh oysters and cold beer, even on a rainy day.We knew we had a long day of eating and drinking ahead of us but we were cold, wet and very hungry. So, she ordered a bowl of \"Boston\" Clam Chowder and I ordered the Linguini with clams.  Growing up my whole life between Boston and Nantucket, I'd say I'm a pretty discerning 'chowdah' enthusiast.  The flavor of their chowder was spot on! The only drawback was the thickness.  For some reason, all the chowder in SanFran is like pancake batter but, traditional 'New England Clam Chowder' is made with scalded milk and sometimes a splash of heavy cream - so NOT that thick. Think more along the lines of tomato soup thickness.  At least this clam chowder wasn't AS thick as the other places we went to on this trip.  But the bacon, potatoes and nice big pieces of clam we're all delicious. I'd definitely order it again.The linguini however, was THE BEST I've ever had...ever!  The first thing I did was take a piece of the crunchy sourdough and dip it in the sauce to get a taste.  The next thing I knew, I was half way through the bowl and forgot to take a picture of the dish at service.  Hence the attached photo looking like a half eaten bowl of pasta.  The linguini was cooked perfectly, the clams were tender, and the sauce was Heaven.  I would put that sauce on anything.  I actually contemplated ordering some sauce to go but I didn't want to carry it around with me all day.  I'm looking forward to my next trip to the City by the Bay just to come back to Sotto. I WILL be back!Food: 10/10Drink: 8/10Service: 10/10",
            "Let me start with it's worth the wait ! Service may not be that fast but that's because they are so busy !!! Inside is not that big, but they do have outdoor seatings. It's definitely a nice place to go when it's sunny in SF. They start you off with bread (not toasted) and butter but they have oil and salt on the side for dip!FOOD: West coast oysters $1.50 for one and we ordered a dozen and all tasted super fresh. Clams $1.50 for one | I never tried raw clams before so I can't compare but it's pretty dam good !Clam chowder $5 for a cup which was super creamy and had bits of bacon pieces.BEST DAM CIOPPINO (5/5) for $44.95 is what it is! the best dam cioppino in sf! this can feed 2-4 and the broth was amazing with tons of crab, clams, mussels, and shrimp !",
            "Sotto Mare is a quaint bustling seafood place that gives off that strong SF fisherman vibe that all tourists are looking for. Located in Little Italy, it's nice to just step away from the FiDi! We didn't make a reservation on a Friday night, we arrived at 6:30pm and waited about 30 minutes for our seat, which is not too bad! Walking in was an experience. People and seafood everywhere. It's not your fancy spacious restaurant. Sotto Mare gives off that no frill quality food vibe that I adore. We opted to sit at the counter so we can watch the chefs cook while we wait for our delicious seafood to arrive. We ordered the highly recommended \"Best Damn Crab Cioppino\" ($44.95) and the Crab Diavolo with linguine ($22.95 for half order) to share, and I also got 2 fresh oysters (only $1.50 each!) for myself. The oysters were really plump and fresh, super worth it, creamy, and sweet! I wish I got more of these but gotta save my stomach for the other dishes! The Cioppino was quality, there were tons of crab, small scallops, shrimps, and mussels, but I expected the broth to be more strong in seafood flavor. The shrimps and scallops were unfortunately the frozen ones. I thought it was delicious, but didn't really impressed me too much. The Crab Diavolo was on the mellower side in terms of flavor. Tons of butter and garlic but seems to be lacking some salt. The crab was really fresh and sweet though. A bit spicy and I like that. A bit pricey but quality seafood restaurant. The food didn't wow me too much but you also pay for the ambiance. I really liked their SF wharf fisherman flare and the experience watching them fire up all the seafood in the kitchen. Really good oysters, fresh seafood. A good spot for locals and tourists alike!",
            "My friend and I came in on a Friday night to celebrate her birthday. The space was quite empty but we sat at the bar. I wished they had offer to seat us at a bigger table (for 4). The entire time we were there no one else sat in those tables. As for food, we ordered a cup of clam chowder, fettuccine with smoked salmon, and risotto. We shared and each had its own taste. The chowder has a big peppery taste. Fettuccine was good because it wasn't smothered in thick sauce. The risotto on the other hand was weird. It was drier than most and had a lot of rice. They do not serve desserts so that was unfortunate.",
            "This is one of the most famous places in SF and for good reason as everything on the menu is super fresh and delicious!  Their servers are always super friendly and actually pretty funny - on our most recent trip as we were deciding on which wine to order our server basically said it doesn't matter you're here for the seafood lol! We started with oysters and Manila clams on the half shell, which were both super fresh and briny.  We went with a bowl of the Boston Clam chowder and Benita's baccala for starters and for entrees shared the crab cioppino (duh), crab diavolo (basically linguine with heapings of dungeness crab pieces and dripping in a spicy and garlicky sauce) and a diver scallops sauté.  Everything was so rich and umptuous with the scallops seared perfectly and super generous portions of crab and seafood in both the Diavolo and the cioppino.  Pro-tip #1: If your party is at least 3 make sure you snag a reso as this place can get super busy (and you don't want to risk getting stuck at one of the hallway tables which are super narrow and very busy with servers)Pro-tip #2: Ask for loaves of bread at a time as you'll need it to sop up all of the goodness from every single dish.  The servers understand this and will happily keep them coming if you ask :)Pro-tip #3:  If you can manage it stop by Golden Boy next door and grab a slice of their iconic square clam and garlic.  Perfect way to end the meal!",
            "Well that was the \"Best Damn Cioppino\"Hell I'd go so far as to say that was the best seafood stew I've ever had.  Just delicious from start to finish and I didn't finish it.  That's saying something, because I'm 6'4\", 275lbs, and had just climbed that Lombard bastard of a hill.  Why we started three blocks before those wicked turns is beyond me.  Off topic...But to finish the compliment.  I ordered the Boston Clam Chowder as well.  Delicious!  I am familiar with the New England & Manhattan styles, but big kudos for the Boston one.  Our beers  were affordable and they had a nice selection considering.  The restaurant is small.  Very narrow with a long counter facing the kitchen like an old school diner and a string to tables on the wall separated by a few foot walking path.  This restaurant has a real hometown feel and the casual service is perfect.  If your in San Francisco stop in for a big bowl of delicious.  Use the bib. I pride myself on not making a mess and use a fork and knife like I'm from France.  But this bowl off amazing ya just gotta get your hands in.",
            "Hello, 2019. Let this be my opening review of the year. It's been busy times and I cannot even begin to tell you guys how excited I was to have Sotto Mare be my starter. Hands down, I have to tell you that 100% of my trips here have been 100%. Every single time. With or without reservations. Accomodation:We had reservations for a party of 4, 01/09/19, at 7pm. One of our members was running late from work and I had to call for a push back. Laura picked up the phone and my, oh, my, she is a sweet woman who is definitely accommodating of the situation (it was raining pretty hard). We were able to change our reservation to 8pm and it was perfect. Ubered ourselves to the location and checked in early with Laura. She was assisting another party who was facing a similar issue and was kind and considerate enough to let us know how long it would take to set up the tables. We were early and didn't mind a 10min wait - so off we went to the bar next door for a sec. Environment/Ambiance: We came back and the tables were ready and she seated us downstairs. yes, there's a downstairs dining room. It's not as narrow as upstairs/main floor but you also don't get to sit at the bar and watch your meals be made. I have never put in a request as to where I'd like to be seated so I'm not sure how that works but I am positive you can speak to Laura about it if you have preferences. We are always seated downstairs and there's a more intimate feeling. It's a comfortable little room that has about 8 tables. Food:East Coast + West Coast Oysters + Clams on half shell are a must have as appetizers! Enjoy them by yourself, with another or with a party! They're super fresh and refreshing and you won't regret it. Instead, you'll want to order more. Promise.Cioppino: The food definitely speaks for itself. We always order the same things here and one of those things is the cioppino. \"The Best Damn Crab Cioppino,\" yes, that one. The portion is definitely more than enough for two, filled with an amazing punch of flavor from crab, clams, mussels, with some pasta (penne). DO NOT SKIP THIS.Crab Diavolo comes with linguine and it definitely has a bite. When the girl taking our order (i missed her name) asked us if we liked/could eat spicy, I have to say, I was skeptical. I always get so hyped up for \"spice\" but there's never any but, OH BOY, was this packing some spice. It was amazing. I'm surprised we had never ordered it before. But for 2 people, we normally order the other 3 dishes and that's just slightly over ordering. Definitely going to order this from now on. DO NOT SKIP THIS.Muscles/Clams Steamers (combo) - WHY CHOOSE ONE WHEN YOU CAN HAVE BOTH????? Don't even think about skipping this. It's so simple yet so elegant and amazing. With every bite you can taste both the mussels and the clams but still be able to distinguish that it's a combination of separate flavors. Risotto with Seafood - for anybody who has issues with cheese and cream like I do, you can bet your bottom dollar with me on this one. It is to die for. It's not incredibly heavy and it's not \"creamy\" or cheesy. There is definitely butter (in everything) but it's soooooooo worth it. Take a dive and try this at least once. Best risotto I've had by far (no lies).",
            "A mom and pop gem near Fisherman's wharf with fresh seafood offerings! I was visiting San Francisco for work and my friends and I had cravings for seafood. On yelp, this came as a highly recommended place and when we got there, the restaurant seemed smaller and not as what we had thought in terms of fanciness. However, the food was amazing and even though there was only one waitress for the evening, she was so accommodating! My clam linguine was incredible. The clams were large and meaty. Tasted delicious with the white wine (slightly creamy) sauce. The noodles were cooked to perfection as well. We needed our checks to be split 6 ways which can be tricky for a restaurant especially one with only one person working at the time (since another waitress called out sick) but she was more than accommodating. I was also excited when they brought over bibs for us to wear.",
            "Absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it.We were lucky to have gotten a last minute reservation for three and didn't have to wait long. We sat on the top floor and enjoyed the smells wafting from the kitchen. We ordered the crab cioppino and it was really delicious! If you look around, every table has one.  Get ready to slurp up the tomato soup-like base or use your bread to get it done! We also had a dozen oysters, crab salad (yummy) and the clam linguine noodle.  We thought the linguine noodle tasted more like fettechini noodle sauce - but it was still very good. The wines were great! You can go wrong here as everything we had tasted wonderful and we would certainly come again!",
            "Amazing seafood, cozy atmosphere! I recommend making a reservation because it's a small space but a very popular dining option. I like to sit inside so my food doesn't get cold, but patio seatings are an option as well. This is not the place to eat if you're looking for a quick bite and fast service, since these delicious dishes take time to make.Food was spectacular, I can still taste the cioppino! -Cioppino: highly recommend this! It is a large portion that comes with an impressive seafood assortment . It can serve two hungry people or three mildly hungry eaters. Make sure you save room for this dish because it does come with a bed of pasta.-Linguine with Manila clams: cream-based pasta with tons of Manila clams. Well seasoned sauce and clams, but my money is still on the cioppino. -octopus salad: deliciously fresh octopus salad that serves as a nice appetizer. Well cooked and soft, nothing too chewy. The dressing was great too. -clam chowder cup: among three people, we only got one just to try it out. Didn't disappoint, it was creamy and loaded with lots of clams. I think this is my new favorite seafood spot in SF, I will definitely be returning!",
            "We went there at night and we had to wait for almost 2 hours but it was worth for waiting.I love seafood,love crab and pasta . Yummy I had been here serveral time and look forward to comeback here again.",
            "I made reservations to have dinner with my family while vacationing in San Francisco. I saw the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. The food was amazing !!!!  The best ciopinno I ever had in my life ... I'm craving it as I write this. The most delicious sauce and the freshest seafood used to make this. Big portion enough for two. Reasonably priced. We also tried the linguini clams in white sauce and let me tell you ...it was bomb... As soon as you walk in the smell of the food makes you super hungry.  Cute little restaurant with fun decorations. Since there was 8 of us we were seated in the basement area right by the storage room and it was very uncomfortable and not as pretty as upstairs. Also Our waitress was a little rude  and annoyed but that didn't stop us from enjoying our delicious food and writing this 5 star review.  We will definitely be back when visiting San Francisco.",
            "The best damn cioppino is truly one of those dishes that lived up to its name! So flavorful, so much seafood, great crab legs!! The risotto is also good but the soup really is for two so we couldn't eat allOf it in one sitting. The staff was so nice when we picked up and Can't wait to come back again!",
            "3 stars is generous considering the terrible service.Stumbled across this place without meaning to, and put our name on the waitlist because food looked really good. Guy managing the line is rude, and consistently tells every party the same thing: \"5 more minutes, 5 more minutes.\" I timed it, and we waited \"5 more minutes\" for a whole 45 minutes. If I had known, I would've left.Experience was already off to a terrible start. Everyone already eating took their sweet time, ordering glasses of wine even after paying the bill - so be prepared to wait. We finally got seats at the bar and it was cramped. Everything at this restaurant, for a more \"Italian\" feel, is outdated. They keep handwritten ledgers - no Yelp waitlists, no Square, no cashier register, no technology at all. I saw our server documenting her tips on a yellow notepad she pulled from a drawer. How interesting. Also, sitting at the bar gives you front row seats to restaurant operations, and the staff was STRESSED OUT. It was nearing 9pm and you could tell they were over it. Not exactly a good look. Also, we didn't get any attention at the bar and it was extremely loud. Thus the bad service continues.Lastly, I was super annoyed that the said-rude guy at the host counter offered everyone complimentary wine except us. Clearly there is some bias happening. Good food, but will not return."

            "5 spice chicken bahn mi sammich  Got a great discount using my Ritual App, Went after the main lunch rush and got a yummy well made sandwich. Rest of their menu looks worth a try as well. Will check out again",
            "Definitely an upgrade from the steam table Chinese-American fast food that was here before.  Everything seems freshly made to order.  The quality isn't as good as joints in Little Saigon or even Out The Door a few blocks away though.  It's still better than a boring generic salad / soup / sandwich place, which is way too prevalent in the FiDi lunch scene.Fresh Spring Roll w/ Buttermilk Chicken & Avocado: When ever I see \"chicken\" and \"buttermilk\", I think fried chicken.  Unfortunately, I learned that the word \"fried\" was omitted because it was indeed not fried.  But, thankfully, it ended up being tender and tasty.  The roll itself was made fresh to order and you could tell because the rice paper was nice and supple.  Very large portion too.Imperial Roll: These were probably the best item I tried.  Super crispy shell with a dense meaty flavorful center.  When wrapped in lettuce with some noodles and dipped in the sauce, so delicious!  Kinda filling though, so definitely split this else you won't be able to finish your main course.Garlic Noodles w/ Filet Mignon: Sounded better on paper.  The garlic noodles weren't as good as An the Go / Crustacean.   Kinda like lo mein noodles that happened to have garlic and soy.  The filet mignon seemed well done and was missing any sort of nice sear, gray all around.  It was cheaper than a typical filet mignon dish, so I suppose my expectations can't be too high.Pho Noodle Combo: Had to get my favorite trio (steak, beef balls, brisket) and hold the tendon.  It was a good sized bowl.  The broth was kinda middling.  Not bad, but definitely not worth a special trip.  It had a bit too many noodles for my taste, making it too starchy of an experience.  Similarly, seemed a bit sparse on the meat.",
            "I work not too far from here, and saw the reviews so I figured I'd check it out.Being Vietnamese myself, and seeing that it was a family run place - I kind of had high expectations for this place. I got the Shrimp Vermicelli Bowl, and I have to say - I was IMPRESSSED!! They give you a good amount of sauce which I love because I usually ask for 2 sauces at most places, but here it is not needed. The egg rolls were nice and crunchy, and the carrots were a nice size thickness with lots of flavor. I'm very excited to come back and try other things. My only complaint would be some of their prices. I wanted to order the spring rolls, but they were $7!! So I opted not to.",
            "Very close to work. Definitely an upgrade from the previous vender. Feeling very hungry and in need of something spicy. Got garlic noodles with BBQ beef to go. 5 min wait time. Not too busy at 11:35am on a Thursday. Garlic definitely came though in the noodles but were a bit dry. Curious to know how the beef is considered \"BBQ\"? Beef was good though. Nice refreshing side salad. Didn't quite fill me up but I admit my appetite is not average. Price a little high for what it is in the FiDi area. Total: $14.50 including 15% tip at the register (not fond of tips before service -- like wth?). Feel it should be closer to $12 total. Will come again to try soups/sandwiches. Maybe would give 3.5 if I could but unwilling to round up.",
            "I'm probably going to give this place another chance one day but not order a banh mi sandwich again. I ordered the Buttermilk Chicken Banh Mi Sandwich ($6.50) and it was super dry. The chicken was kind of shredded and not what I expected. The jalapeno piece was huge and was about a couple of inches long. The bread was thick and not too crunchy. The toppings tasted very light. In general, the sandwich was pretty average and cheap.My friend ordered Garlic Noodles with BBQ Pork ($13) and thought it was decent but a little dry as well. There was a good amount of meat though. The salad was not bad despite the fact that the dressing was not visible. Was there even dressing on it??I also got free Thai tea from checking into Yelp. It was just ok. This marks the end of my visit to Noodle Time for now.",
            "Rating based off of a mealpal meal that I got, which was their mongolian beef, and a thai iced tea I received for doing a yelp check in deal. The portion was medium-sized for a meal pal, so it wasnt that great, but the flavor was really good. It came with white rice on the side as well. I am sure their normal priced meals are better-portioned. The thai iced tea itself makes this place a 3.5 star place. It really wasnt very good. I didnt think it was possible to have anything less than praise for thai tea, but this place changed my mind. It was just okay. Overall the mongolian beef was solid!",
            "This place is directly underneath my office - I go here mostly out of convenience but it's pretty good. I would really give a 3.5/5 but rounding it up because the portions are super generous. The imperial rolls (pictured) are really tasty. It's an appetiser (there are 4, but I stuffed one into my face before I remembered to take a photo) and it comes with vermicelli and salad (generous!). The curry noodles are so good. It can be a tiny bit variable in terms of the veg that goes in, and the spice level but it's never bad. The wonton noodles (I get mine with vermicelli instead of egg noodles) are very hearty but perhaps lack a little something. I usually season it further. The broth on both is always piping hot, which I appreciate and is annoyingly rare. The prices are okay. You'll get cheaper if you walk ten minutes into china town, but for convenience it's pretty good.",
            "Consistently good quality food. My coworkers and I like to come here when we run out of ideas of what to eat. Our go-to is the BBQ Pork Vermicelli bowl. The meat is always cook well, no charred or burnt spots like some vietnamese restaurants. Nice big portions. And overall good taste. I have to say the buttermilk chicken is bleh and pass on it. Garlic noodle is also a bit bland. But the sandwiches and vermicelli are great choices. Remember to check in for a free thai ice tea. You may also order on ritual and that's a pretty fast service too!",
            "Mmmm I came here with my coworker today because it looked like it was going to rain! Ah, SF weather... I got the Seafood bowl (egg noodles, fish cake(2), fish balls (3), halibut pieces (2), imitation crab (2), shrimp (3) and fried fish cake (2). This tasted pretty good. Good amount of saltiness, hot, decent amount of seafood and noodles. Check in and get a free (slightly diluted) thai iced tea! Would go again.",
            "Love Noodle Time! New found lunch spot close to work. Love that they have a wide variety menu and energy drinks!  they're super fast and super delicious! Will be here at least once a week!",
            "Amazing shrimp garlic noodles! Recommend!The food that I got was good for the price I paid!",
            "I ordered Pho Noodle soup. It was the amazing noodle soup with affordable price. Definitely, I will come back again!",
            "Checked out Noodle Time for lunch today since I was looking for a salad and there aren't a ton of deli options in this area. Saw the Papaya Salad on the website and decided to walk over to try it. The building was easy to miss as there was construction on the sidewalk & the sign was covered. Looks like a small hole in the wall, but there's lots of seating in the back area of the restaurant. Prices are SF comparable and good for the FiDi. Ordered the salad and took about 5-6 minutes to get it. Didn't hear them call my number, so it sat on the counter for a bit before I realized it was there. Got the salad to go and it was packaged great - chopsticks, fork, peanuts & dressings in separate containers. The salad tasted very fresh and had a decent amount of devined, peeled, halved shrimp. Would definitely recommend!",
            "I generally judge Vietnamese places on their banh mi, but I'd like to make an exception.I have tried their banh me, and the curry chicken. Loved the curry, was disappointed with the banh me, and the Thai tea. But the curry is good enough for me to keep coming back. Reasonably priced, good portions, great taste= great lunch spot for weekdays. My coworkers seem to love it too. Wish they'd stop handing out plastic bags by default though.",
            "Pretty tasty spot that's hidden nearby the embarcadero   center. I love their garlic noodles from mealpal and the portion was the perfect amount. I looked at the menu and they have crab noodle soup too. Maybe I will try that next! FYI, this place take a little longer to prepare the food because they are fresh.",
            "Terrible food, over priced for the neighborhood, employees are rude and portions are really small. I paid over $5 for a 'large coffee and was served a large cup less then half full that already had milk and someothertype of creamer in it. I asked why the cup was so empty when I paid so much and the cashier told me that's what the machine put out so it must be right in a very cocky tone, apparently he didn't want to put his phone down long enough to help me.This is the second and last time I will ever use this establishment, and I urge others to take their business elsewhere.",
            "This is my absolute favorite lunch place when I'm at work!! The workers are so friendly even during the lunch rush hour. Also, I've come here so many times for my MealPal, and even when I come late they are so accommodating. All the foods are priced incredibly reasonably. Some of my favorite items are:- Any of the vermicelli bowls, but I love the pork- Garlic noodles. These are SOO garlicy but there's so such thing as too much garic for me, which is why I love it!- Fried rice- Bahn mis are fresh and warm- Thai iced tea (they have a promo going on for checking in, make sure you use it!)",
            "It was my usual go-to lunch spot, until I found hair in my wonton soup today. I don't need the extra keratin, thank you.",
            "We work right around the corner from here and have this gem in our weekly rotation (sometimes 2 times a week!). Though it looks unassuming this family run business has amazingly good quality food. Everything is made fresh, all the rolls are made to order, they have deep delicious broth soups and are open to adjustments. I usually get the Pho without meat and sub extra veggies.",
            "I had such high hopes for this place after seeing the change of ownership and all the recent good reviews, but was dumbfounded after my first visit. The food was incredibly awful. I thought maybe I happened to order exactly the wrong thing, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went back two more times, and I'll never visit again. I had their seafood noodle soup and spicy beef noodle soup. The broth had no flavor at all, literally tasted like warm tap water. I also tried their garlic noodle with beef. The noodle was soggy and the beef tasted stale, with a strange disgusting sheen on the surface! And to top it off the portion is tiny for $13. I'm not the world's biggest fan of Sai's but you could walk two blocks there and get a meal twice the size for $3 less. Absolutely not recommended."

            "What a Great combination of Chinese and Japanese food Z & Y Bistro has!  From the Yakitori to the Ramen to the spicy dumplings to the sautéed Pea sprouts with garlic, we were very impressed with the explosion of tastes, attentive and friendly service, and variety of options available here. Visiting from out of town, my main goal was to find a good unique and flavorful meal for the family. This place hit it on the spot. Most Japanese places have sushi, bento boxes, noodles, and rice bowls, but it's hard to find good Yakitori...until you come here. We booked a table for 5 (3  adults, 2 kids) and everyone raved about each dish that came out.  We were in SF for 6 days and the meal we had here was the best we had during our entire trip (after consulting Yelp and selecting 4 other top rated places).  I cannot wait to go back.I'd recommend getting a reservation if you can.--------TL;DR--------PROS: Everything we had here was great! I'd recommend the yakitori miso pork and the asparagus beef. The bacon wrapped tomato was maybe my least favorite but still excellent.CONS: luckily we got a reservation but as we left we saw several people waiting. It might get tough to get a table on a busy night.  Don't get this place confused with Z&Y Restaurant, down the street.BOTTOM LINE: definitely a fun and delicious experience here--I can't wait to come back to SF for another visit",
            "Came for lunch around 11:45 with 3 others on a Thursday and it was pretty empty. I called and made reservations the day before, but I really didn't need them.Z & Y Bistro is relatively new and is owned by the same owners as Z & Y Restaurant, which is right across the street. Unless its sister restaurant which is smaller and more dingy, the bistro has a nicer ambiance with modern decorations and a lot more space to walk around.The menu here, while it features some of the spicy dishes that the original restaurant is known for, also has an interesting variety of other dishes, ranging from appetizers to hot pot to skewers to soup noodles.We ordered a couple dishes to share:Chicken thigh skewers ($7.95) - just okay. The meat was a little bland. Would skip this unless you really like chicken thighChicken wing skewers (($7.95) - could use more salt and pepper but otherwise good. I liked how they cut the chicken wing in half and then stuck it on the skewerMiso pork skewers ($7.95) - the group favorite! The pork was mildly sweet and tenderLanzhou ramen ($12.95) - non-spicy noodle soup. Comes with slices of beef and perfectly cooked noodles in a beef bone broth Chongqing spicy noodle ($10.95) - didn't try any because it was spicy but my friends really enjoyed thisChicken with chili pepper ($18.95) - also didn't try this, but it was recommended by our server as one of their most popular dishes. Looked similar to the same dish at Z & Y Restaurant",
            "Here for a quick weekday dinner. TLDR: nice ambiance and good service for authentic chinese food! Ambiance: trendy and modern, unlike your typical chinatown placesService: decentFood: Skewers (4/5) - we had the duck breast and chicken liver and both were delicious but pricey Bamboo shoots (3/5) - portion on the small side but flavor is okaySizzling spicy fish (4.5/5) - super tender silky fish balanced with spice and flavorBeef pot (4/5) - a little too sweet for me but very heartyLanzhou beef noodle (5/5) - this was AMAZING. Excellent chewy noodles and authentic soup base. And fairly priced.Overall a great traditional pricey chinese food place in a modern setting",
            "I'm a really big fan of the original Z & Y restaurant so I was excited to try this place when I found out about it. We came on Sunday around 2pm and the restaurant was pretty empty, therefore no wait. The decor is definitely nicer and fancier than the original restaurant, with a modern design. The menu is interesting - a blend of Chinese and Japanese fusions, with some of the famous dishes from the original Z&Y and the addition of yakitori. We ordered two yakitori, the Asparagus beef ($8.95) and the Chicken Gizzards ($7.95). The Asparagus beef was good, whereas the Chicken Gizzard was average. Both came with two skewers and the portions are pretty small. We also got the Couple's delight, which my favorite dish from the original Z&Y. It taste good, but I think a little less spicy than the original's. Lastly, we got the Sukiyaki hot pot ($21.95), which took forever to be served for some reason. The pot came with A LOT of vegetables, most of which I hope could be replaced with mushrooms, tofus, or some other ingredients. The soup was more sweet than salty. The beef was good, but unfortunately I wished they gave more. Overall, the restaurant was decent, but I prefer the original 100% more. The service was slow given how empty the restaurant was. I'm glad I gave this a try, but I most likely wouldn't come back.",
            "Wow another great new restaurant in Chinatown.  Excellent decor and service and not too pricey.  A new trend of restaurants in Chinatown - usually I worry about Chinese restaurant that has high end decor.  We ordered - fish with flaming oil.  Super yummy and numbing. Not too spicy- asparagus beef yakitori.  So tender.  We ordered two more. - chicken thigh.  My daughter loved it. - lamb chops.  My older daughter also loved it- pea sprouts - a bit pricey but really well made. We will be back to try the seafood hot pot and the Lanzhou ramen.  So glad to find another good restaurant in Chinatown and the good service and decor is bonus.   Only reason it's not five stars is because it's my first time here.  Not sure about their consistency yet.  Will upgrade if it stays good. ;-)",
            "Ate here on a weeknight a few weeks ago with a party of 4. I had heard about Z&Y restaurant but our friend made a reservation here instead. We just moved to SF and had lived in mainland China a few years ago so we had high expectations for Chinese food. I was at first skeptical because the decor is too trendy for a place in Chinatown. We ordered and it surprisingly was really good if you're craving proper Chinese food.We ordered the dishes we loved to eat in China:-Bamboo Shoots in sesame oil: This is my favorite cold dish appetizer. I was surprised they had it here. It was delicious-Mapo Tofu: We ordered this one and it's the vegetarian version. It's not the best mapo tofu I've ever eaten but it's very decent.-Spicy Fish: We looooved eating this in China and this version is decent. It's not too spicy and the numbing peppercorns are not too overwhelming.-Chicken with Explosive Pepper: This is also a great dish especially if you love deep-fried food. Both this dish and the spicy fish are not that spicy. The chili is mostly to make it look dramatic.Overall, it's a great place for decent Chinese food if you don't want to wait in line for the original Z&Y restaurant.",
            "When my friend suggested that we try Z&Y, I thought she meant the famous Sichuan restaurant where President Obama comes to dine but it turned out to be the new, trendier bistro down the street.  We came here early on a Saturday night and were really happy with our dining experience. The menu is fusion Chinese/Japanese and includes things like dumplings, yakitori, robata, hot pots and ramen.  We shared the spicy pork dumplings, lamb chop robata, grilled Saba, shishito pepper and shitake mushroom yakitori, stir-fry pea sprouts and seafood hotpot.  Everything was good but the veggies (shishito peppers, pea sprouts and veggies in the hotpot) were the star of this meal. The broth in the seafood hotpot was perfect and had great dashi flavor.  I'm impressed by the food here. Service was also good and the restaurant itself is nice and trendy. It's a nice addition to the Chinatown food scene.  With tax and tip, this was under $70 per person, which is relatively affordable for SF dining these days. Highly recommended!!!",
            "I loved everything about Z&Y Bistro! This may literally be the only good Chinese restaurant that I know with a trendy/pretty ambience (bc who looks for ambience when getting good Chinese food?). Service was particularly great, too. I'd go back for sure. I also love that they take reservations - mine was for 5:30PM on a Saturday (for 2).FOODSo good! I've also been to the \"original\" Z&Y down the street, and I didn't think there was a difference between the quality of the food (more limited selection here, but the most popular Chinese dishes are still available). We had the:* Chicken w/ explosive chili pepper (love)* Mapo tofu (love)VIBEI loved the vibe here! Pretty interior, well-lit but not too bright, fun but not too loud. SERVICEAmazing! Wouldn't be 5/5 without the notable service. MONEY THOTotally reasonable, in my opinion! Great deal.",
            "My bf and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. The location is great - in the heart of Chinatown and you're steps away from teas, desserts, and more good food. Not that you'll really have the stomach after a meal from here, haha. Serving sizes are quite generous here, it's great :) We tried a bunch of different things on the menu, including:- Duck breast and pork collar yakitori: Both of these were amazing. Each order comes with two skewers, so perfect for two! So much flavor!! If I had to choose, I'd probably pick the duck breast simply because it wasn't as fatty. But man, both are delicious.- Sukiyaki hot pot: This is one hefty hot pot. It comes with so many things! Quality beef (very tender and flavorful), lots and lots of veggies, noodles, and a delicious broth. We knew we were going to have a hard time finishing the Lanzhou ramen when this dish came out. But both are so worth getting. - Lanzhou ramen: Don't expect traditional Japanese ramen, that's not what this is. This is more of a traditional Chinese beef noodle soup. Very light but hearty. The beef in this dish was also delicious, but very different from the beef in the sukiyaki hot pot. And they give a crazy amount of noodles. In a good way, but not good for my diet! New years resolutions already down the drain, haha.The workers here are all very friendly and attentive. And prices are quite reasonable! We will definitely be back!",
            "Just down the street from the og Z & Y, this sister restaurant is everything I would hope a hip, wine bar spin-off of Z & Y would be. Although, warning, I still have yet to make it to the original.Nonetheless, I stopped by on a weekday early in the evening. Entering to an empty restaurant, I was instantly seated and attended to. The staff was friendly throughout my meal, and was able to make some great recommendations for food.On my own, I ordered the fish in flaming chilli oil and the pork collar yakitori plus a side of rice. The yakitori was a spur of the moment addition and let me say it was one of my best decisions that week. The pork collar was delicious and perfectly cooked to highlight its fatty nature. If nothing else, do yourself a favor and order some yakitori.Meanwhile, the fish was also amazing, tingling my tastebuds. I don't often get sichuan food, so I'm always super happy when I do and it's cooked to perfection. The dish was definitely large enough to feed two people, yet somehow I was able to eat this all alone. A true testament to its flavor.Overall, this was one of the best meals during my trip to SF. I don't know why it was empty, but let me tell you everyone else in the city is crazy for not being there.",
            "This would have been a 5-star rating for me, except they charged us $0.30 for each to-go box and $0.10 for the to-go bag (without telling us in advance). I've never been charged for these things at a sit-down restaurant in SF.",
            "Ok Z, I'm paying attention, you doing good!When it comes to Szechuan, it's Z & Y then Chili House. Welp, Chili House just got bumped to third. They're all sister restaurants but the Bistro is a nice diversion. There's some class, and charm here. I'm digging the izakaya and ramen options, but this round we stuck with their big hitter, the fish with peppercorn - was looking for more of a slow burn then an outright sinus clearing evening lol.We also ordered the mapo tofu, and man oh man so silky!One thing I wished was on the menu that's on Z & Y, is the Salty Egg Yolk Prawns... Please add that and I will always come here first!!!!",
            "Heard a lot of good things of their original Z&Y restaurant but was thoroughly disappointed at the food at Z&Y Bistro. We ordered:Suziyaki hotpot - super bland. Everything seemed to be precooked and assembled in the pot right before serving. Honestly it was pretty bad.. bland with over cooked meat and veggies.Duck breast yakitori - a little over cooked and chewy as well.Couples delight - average but definitely the best out of the 3 items we ordered. Perhaps because it was an item carried on from their original Chinese restaurant? Service was good with a modern/hip atmosphere so I decided to give this place 2 stars but do not recommend and most likely will not revisit.",
            "Food: 4 | Service: 5 | Ambiance: 4I've been to many Chinese restaurants and I think this might've been the best service I've received at one. I might even say it's over-serviced because they came to ask how our dish was multiple times. The food was great! We ordered the fish in hot chili oil and boy was it numbing. I had to carefully navigate around the sea of numbing peppercorns and the actual chilis themselves. It's not as spicy as it looks though. We also ordered the chicken thigh yakitori and that was delicious as well (eat it while it's hot btw) Overall the ambiance, the food, and the service combined made for an excellent experience!",
            "*** In Short ***Tasty Chinese and Japanese fare from the folks that brought you, well, Z & Y, duh.*** In Depth ***If I'm being entirely honest, Z & Y Bistro rates more closely to the 3.5 stars I gave their sister restaurant, but I'm not about to be THAT guy and round down yet: not for a restaurant as new as this, anyway, and especially when they still might be working out some kinks.Expect a selection of popular Sichuan dishes they carry at their original up the street, along with a smattering of Japanese eats like yakitori and ramen. Having tried some of these latter items, I'd definitely recommend their skewers (the duck breast and pork collar were excellent), and, if you're a fan of the lighter style noodle soups you'd find in places like House of Pancake, their Lanzhou ramen as well, a Chinese prickly ash-seasoned beef noodle soup.Oh, and the best part? They take reservations, so if they carry what you would normally get at Z & Y, definitely come here instead and skip the wait!***Accessibility Info***Venue - The interior of the restaurant is quite spacious, and quite accessible. Both the restaurant and the entrance itself, however, are up minor inclines, but their is a handy ADA door opener to get in, so you won't have to awkwardly struggle with the door while on a ramp.Bathroom - Didn't check them out.",
            "The ambiance. The service. The FOOD. Everything about everything was on point at the new Z&Y Bistro in Chinatown. The bud and I are majorly fans of the Szechuan cuisine, and most definitely fans of the Z&Y chain of restaurants (they also own Chili House in Richmond). After hearing about the Bistro opening, we made ressies for a Thursday evening at 5:30pm. Was the ressie necessary? No, not really. Pretty empty dining room with only 4-5 other tables seated. The wait staff was extremely attentive and well trained to explain the menu options. I meannnn no need to tell me twice. I knew we were ordering the boiled peppercorn fish situation! Went family style on the dinner. Two bowls of jasmine rice (absolutely needed for the delicious boiled fish soup), boiled fish with peppercorns (more numbing, less spicy than the chili one), and ma pao tofu (confirmed there's no animal meat in this dish). And how did it all turn out? Amazing! The fish was beautifully poached and flakey. The soup made for a deliciously numbing sauce for the rice. The mao pao tofu looks scarier than it is - soft tofu, seasoned with chilis, blended well in btw the fish and the rice. Despite only ordering two dishes (plus rice), we had so much leftovers that we felt like we over ordered. Wish I could've fit more food into the belly haha. The waitstaff let us know that a wine bar will be coming soon(!) downstairs! Best of all, this restaurant isn't overrun with crowds and tourists (yet!). Looking forward to more visits and future explorations of more dishes. 5 stars woot",
            "Cheers to the chef! Had asparagus beef skewers, spicy and regular boiled dumplings~~ all were wonderful! The beef was especially tender and flavorful, and the spicy dumplings were bathed in a great mix if red oil and crushed red pepper with a sprinkling of scallions. Highly recommend their spicy dumplings! We also used the spicy sauce on our regular dumplings since there was extra sauce; so if you have friends who aren't great with spice you can let them create their own flavor balance. It is a bit dim inside, so people who like restaurants with mood lighting or want to duck out of the sun will enjoy the atmosphere.",
            "My boyfriend and I are loyal, long-time customers of Z & Y right across the street, but there's always a looooong line. Today (8/25/2018) when we came by, we noticed this little spot open right across the street and found out from the waiter that it's a sister restaurant. They have the same popular dishes from Z and Y, such as the fish in flaming oil and the chicken with spicy chili pepper, but also serve Japanese food such as ramen, yakitori, and hot pots. It looks to be much more upscale than Z and Y, with a smaller menu, a bar, marble-esque tables, and clean minimalistic decor. We ordered our usual chicken with spicy chili pepper, a chicken gizzard skewer, and the sukiyaki hot pot. The chicken wasn't as crispy nor spicy nor flavorful as Z & Y, but I think because the chef didn't let the oil heat up first. It was a bit too chewy and moist. Anyways, I think it was a one off and we gave the feedback to the waiter who was super receptive to it. The sukiyaki was good, but I'd prefer a thicker or less broth. Also, typically sukiyaki is served with raw egg so I'd suggest adding that.Check Instagram.com/elvianathio for my food posts!",
            "With the high reviews and the name, I had higher expectations about Z&Y Bistro. I was very underwhelmed with the flavors and disappointed that we chose to have lunch here. We traveled from Austin to SF for a quick weekend so we had a short list of dining locations. We decided to try the Bistro in hopes for the same flavors of Z&Y in a casual setting. The photos look great but they don't translate. We ordered the spicy beef jerky to start with. It wasn't hot or numbing. Dumplings were bland. And the tonkotsu ramen was flavorless. The yakitori's weren't bad. We had the chicken and leeks, gizzard, and liver. It's possible we just ordered all the wrong things. We wanted a quick lunch so we didn't order the main entrees. Either way, the choices we did make were average and left disappointed.",
            "Great restaurant in Chinatown with a very chill atmosphere. Tasty wines and food make for a great combination. They have lots of skewer dishes as well as Ramen so all of the bases are covered. I got a reservation on a Sunday night but it seemed unnecessary as the place wasn't too packed."

            "Lovely place. Lovely people. But most importantly, lovely food! Seriously, I'm so glad I live one minute away from this new gem in North Beach. They've been open for less than a month but I've been here about five times already. I always get the wet burrito with carne asada, Spanish rice, pinto beans, and their super yummy (and spicy!) habanero sauce. The burrito is HUGE and I get two meals out of it.Their chips and guac are delicious as well. The interior is spacious and they have quite a few tables for a small North Beach restaurant. For the price and quality, you really can't beat this place. Would absolutely recommend Adolfo's, come check it out!",
            "I was disappointed by my first (and probably only) meal at Adolfo's. I stopped by on my way home because I was craving a burrito and the food looked good from the photos on Yelp. When I walked in, there was only one person in front of me. Even still, it took almost ten minutes before someone took my order. Things behind the counter seemed very disorganized. After I placed my order (a vegetarian burrito with guacamole), it took another ten minutes for them to make my food. The burrito cost almost $14 before tax and tip, but came with free chips. When I first bit into the burrito, I was surprised to find that it was filled with random grilled vegetables, like green beans, lettuce, and mushrooms. I've never had mixed veggies in a burrito before. I ate about half of the burrito, and never got a guacamole bite. The beans and Spanish rice were good, but the rest of it was just too out there. Maybe I should have stuck to a chicken burrito? Either way, I'm still hungry.",

            "Stoked to finally have a great fast Mexican spot in North Beach! Prawn burrito and pork burrito were great. Tortillas are soft, meats are well marinated. Will be back."

            "I had trouble finding this place until I realized this place was literally a little window connected to the side of a building. I came at around 11:15 am on a Friday afternoon and was told in-person orders would start at 11:30. Apparently, a lot of people do pre-orders online. I should have ordered online since it was 11:15, but I didn't this about it.I ordered Banh Mi ($9) with Coconut Milk Fried Chicken ($2). The banh mi was super crunchy! I felt like I was making a huge mess with the crumbs. It looked like the pigeons were waiting for the right moment to grab the bread crumbs.I was given a lot of pickled veggies and they tasted really fresh. I was glad the sandwich wasn't too saucy. If I could pick up my sandwich without it dripping all over my hands, it's a good sign! The chicken did not taste like coconut milk and it was only slightly crispy. It was not really warm but it could be because it was super cold and I was eating outside under the shade. There are only a few tables near this place. This place is a little costly, but I will probably come back in the future.",
            "The Little Window is located on the side of the building I work in and everytime I go outside there is a HUGE line. So when I wandered out and there was no line, I took it as a sign from the gods. And they didn't lead me wrong! This place is bombbbb- I tried their Vermicelli Noodle Bowl with Tofu as my protein and I ate every last bite. Not to mention I waited less than 2 minutes for my meal so it was the perfect meal for my thirty minute lunch break. (This makes me assume the line goes by pretty fast!) Since then, I have tried the Avocado Toast with a Poached Egg and the Matcha Latte and I am a devoted fan. Pro tip- they give you 10% off if you bring your own bowl or mug!",
            "I've eaten food from little window a couple times since it's the closest Vietnamese food I could get around where I work. This place operates out of a fricken window so I'm not sure why the food is so expensive. Just to be clear, I was never expecting any authenticity when I came in but I do expect a tasty food for the prices they charge. I've tried their grilled pork banh mi sandwich, rice bowl, & honey latte. The latte is AMAZING!! I am actually excited about trying the other drinks cuz the honey latte is so bomb. However, the food here is not worth it! The pork in my banh mi had no flavor and neither did the coconut fried chicken or curry chicken in my rice bowl. The banh mi tastes mostly like the do chua rather than the meat. There could definitely be some improvement in the seasoning as well as the proportions of meat in the sandwich. The sandwich also comes with sriracha mayo instead of the traditional butter/pate which didn't really bother me but might be a turn off to some. When it comes to the rice bowls, the one thing I like is that it comes with brown rice without extra charge but only cuz I love brown rice. I don't know why people are so hyped up about the coconut fried chicken...it was like lukewarm when I got it and the breading was soggy while the meat was dry. Maybe I got an old batch? Even so, the seasonings were not there. The chicken curry was better than the coconut fried chicken but also lacked flavor. Also it's outrageous that they charge $6 for one spring roll that is cut in half. I feel so bad for the people who decide to buy spring rolls here because they deserve better. Please love urself!I recommend this place for the drinks but not for the food.",
            "This is my favorite place for Vietnamese comfort food. My go to place for lunches when at office. It's a all up window on battery street. I love how amazing this place is with the food being extremely simple, fresh and delicious. I've tried all the times on their menu and I specially love the noodle bowl. They also serve some amazinggg avocado toast for breakfast that is to die for. The window is always busy, but manages to get the orders out really fast.",
            "One of the few good options in the immediate area for lunch, Little Window is just that - an outlet located beneath the Williams-Sonoma headquarters. Prices may seem a tad spendy, but they're in line with everything else in the area. Everything is quite authentic, whether the spring rolls, banh mi (please do splurge on the coconut-milk fried chicken!), or the vermicelli noodles. During lunch hours you're virtually assured of a moderate-to-long wait. Pro tip: order online before the daily 11am cut-off so you can scoot right up and pick your stuff up to go.",
            "What a precious little hole in the wall! I ordered the bahn mi with tofu and my friend ordered the wrap with cabbage and cauliflower. The banh mi was delicious and my friend enjoyed her veggie wrap. Don't be like me, giving your toddler a jalapeño thinking it's a pickle: epic mom fail. Then we each had a chocolate chip cookie. Yum.They claim to be: \"Nurturing and sustainable\". Two important elements to have when eating. Their tiny space is decorated so sweetly with cozy lights. Outside seating only. It looks like it's mostly local workers who are taking their lunch breaks.We got there at 11:30 just before the long line formed.If I'm ever in this part of town again, I'll be back for some more Vietnamese.",
            "I ordered catering again and this time, the owner was so much more responsive. Thank you, Jessica!Everything tasted so much better this time.Banh mi w/ curry chicken tasted so much better than the pulled pork I ha the last time.You should the rice bowl with coconut fried chicken rather than the curry chicken.This is definitely a great spot for modern/fusion Vietnamese food.",
            "I love the salad with seasome and this one is even better with peanuts! And the taste is better with some apples. And grilled pork is really good!",
            "Put Google Maps on if you're trying to find this place. The line isn't noticeably out the tent-flap door, and it's literally a little window in a brick alley.Had a late start for work the other day, so I decided to grab lunch from Levi's Plaza. Starbucks wasn't too appealing, but the prospect of good Vietnamese food really was. I was wary of the location and how it'd influence prices. My fears were indeed confirmed: $13 for banh mi (come on, Yelp, get the place's name spelled right!) and a tiny Vietnamese coffee.The grilled pork in the banh mi isn't plentiful enough. It could use a little more lemongrass and citrus to tenderize the meat, because it's not fun trying to tug meat out of your mouth at work. Most of the sandwich consisted of pickled veggies and Sriracha aioli, and it may have tasted better with that signature butter mayo that chains like Lee's Baguette use. Ingredients are really fresh, though, and I was a big fan of the soft bread. Presentation looked great and all the essential ingredients were there.Coffee is delicious, but tiny. It's really got a kick to it -- imagine that a double shot of espresso just got doubled. I was jittery all day after drinking it at noon. They don't overflow it with condensed milk, so it's sweet and creamy without tasting like a Starbucks frappuccino.Among the establishment's highlights: eco-friendly packaging and lots of condiments for their rice bowls and spring rolls. Not too shabby for a business operating out of a window! If I ever scrounge up the cash, I'd definitely return.",
            "Changed my mind about this place. Great coffee and beverages and I'm thankful for them being in this area.",
            "It's true that this place is pricey in comparison to others offering the same but it's one of the few options close to my work so I deal with it.The food itself is super yum. I appreciate that there are multiple vegetarian/vegan options. I almost always get the vegan pho with tofu, but I also got the soup once. Both are good.For all my fellow vegans/vegetarians, I would recommend this spot for the options available.Another note is that it is literally just a window but there a few tables and chairs and couch area behind it to eat at so note that there is some outdoor seating.",
            "Got breakfast from here this morning. Everything was incredible. - avocado toast: Rich in flavor, it has a nice layer of chili pepper flakes on top which gives it a spicy kick. The toast and the chili pepper had toasted sesame seeds on them. The olive oil was good but unnecessary. Very tasty. - mushroom porridge: Very delicious, also rich and flavorful. Has a smokey layer of fried shallots on top but it's not greasy. I thought I was full from the avocado toast, so just trying a bite of the porridge, and ended up inhaling the whole bowl. - Vietnamese iced coffee: I didn't want ice and it ended up being too sweet, but I think it's my bad. Definitely would like to come back for the exact same breakfast here. So impressed with this little place.",
            "Surprisingly good food coming out of this little takeout window which might account for the consistent queues daily. Fancier bahn mi's than you'll find at the Vietnamese sandwich shops in Little Saigon, the sandwiches still hold their own here. I'm typically a fan of a ham combo bahn mi which they don't have here but the slow cooked pork is a great protein in its own right. Tender and packed full of slow-braised fatty flavor, it goes well against the pickled veggies and fresh cilantro. The fresh french baguette makes quite the difference. Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside helps hold the sandwich together well. From breakfast items to other lunchtime fare like fresh rolls and rice or vermicelli bowls, Little Window by Bicycle Bahn Mi is a dependably good spot to grab lunch to-go.",
            "A pricey lunch spot, but when you're a little window shop in between Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma, and Levi's Plaza, what can you expect? So yea, it's pricey, but you get a really good portion of really good food. My usual order is the spring peanut salad with the lemongrass curry chicken, and the salad comes with tons of greens, mint, green apples, A WHOLE AVOCADO (!!!!!) and tons of really good curry chicken. The peanut dressing and peanuts come on the side. The flavors of the salad are complex but not overpowering, and the different textures in the salad also work really well together. Portion is pretty good, but I'm still a little sad dropping over $11 on a salad. It's just close to my office.",
            "Wow - what a blessing it is to have the Little Window in this literal food DESERT. I have been following Jessie and her mom for a long time, and I have seen their business flourish into an iconic destination in SF. They have truly introduced the Bay Area to what I call real food. I grew up watching Food Network (from 3 years old) and I know a real chef and host when I see one. I'm not talking about Pioneer Woman and/or all those game shows hosted by Aaron Samuels from Mean Girls. I'm talking about Sweet Dreams (w/ Gayle Gand) and Barefoot Contessa - those who broke down the barriers of elegance and the classes of chefs and made great food easy and accessible for everyone to share and enjoy. The dishes they continously add to the menu are so much fun and make my breakfast / lunch the highlight of my day. I love The Little Window and knowing that Jessie and her mom are behind the operation make tasting the dish even better. Everyone should take a visit to the window and also follow their pop ups and collaborations around the Bay Area - they cater too! Learn their story while you're at it, because your palate is about to change. You'll discover that unagi.",
            "Long lines but once you place your order it's super speedy! The rice bowl with curry chicken is sure worth the wait, absolutely delicious and healthy!",
            "The lines are ALWAYS long here - and I have no hesitations at all stating why. There has never been anything here that I've not tried that hasn't been fantastic. The place maybe slightly hard to find initially. Although the prices here are slightly higher than what you'd find at places nearby, this is the only place I can honestly say around the area that provides a complete nutritious meal without leaving you feeling too full. Despite the lines, I'd gladly wait the 10 Mins for my daily lunches here. Vietnamese Rice Bowl - $11 with cash (no tax without the cards) and slightly higher on a card. The rice bowl comes with rice, your choice of protein (I think they offer pork, tofu and chicken - maybe fish?) Pictured here is chicken (not spicy at all for those worried - it's more savory with lemongrass) and veggies. This is absolutely amazing! Also very popular here. Vermicelli Noodle Bowl - $12 with cash (slightly higher without) - Slightly larger than the rice bowl with the addition of peanuts and vermicelli. I'd also recommend adding fish sauce. This is so so good - possibly my favorite! Chao Mushroom Porridge - $6 with cash. If you're looking for a slightly lighter meal, this is light but incredible. Portion sizes are as large as a soup cup. Spring Rolls - $6 with cash. Proteins offered - chicken, pork or tofu. Filling and this is a really good snack or lighter meal! If you work around the area and haven't tried this place, you're definitely losing out - so hurry over. Lol I am in no way affiliated with the place but the place is a catch. Don't worry about the lines - it's worth the wait (and the extra $)",
            "Great little gem tucked away by some office buildings. Very fresh tasting banh mi and a delicious warm peanut salad with curry chicken.",
            "Great to have another option in the area for lunch. Definitely pre-order online if you remember by 11am to avoid the long line. The fresh rolls are pretty boring, even with the peanut sauce but everything else I have had has been good including a coconut tomato soup, vermicelli bowl with chicken or pork and the noodle soup.",
            "Kept giving them a chance but I think I've ordered my last pho from Little Window. The broth is consistently oily, the meat is fatty and (this was the last straw) today they substituted vermicelli noodles for pho noodles. Call it noodle soup but don't call it pho, it's misleading for people who know and expect pho."

We waited at the bar about 30 minutes before the table was ready (they have live wait times). The bartender was super friendly and the ambiance was nice! Once seated we enjoyed a nice starter and entree. It was really good and fresh! Definitely not like the tourist seafood joints surrounding this jewel. If you're entitled there are many other seafood restaurants at pier 39. If you want fresh seafood with Italian twist, go here!",
            "Scoma's serves Pacific seafood, caught on small boats, and brought to the pier by local fishermen. They also offer a full bar program with premium crafted cocktails and an extensive award-winning wine list to complement your meal. If you plan on driving, there is free valet service at the door. It all started with six stools and their mother's recipes...In 1965, when brothers Al and Joe Scoma heard about a small coffee shop on the Wharf that was for sale, they had no idea that they were about to create a landmark restaurant. The brothers bought the tiny coffee shop on Pier 47, serving coffee and burgers to local fishermen and shortly thereafter, started expanding.  A savvy businessman who prided himself on going above and beyond, Al  turned a hidden local hangout into one of the nation's highest grossing independent restaurants in a very short time.Al Scoma always believed in working hard, enjoying life and being the best in the business. His restaurant operating experience began in the late 1950s as one of the original six partners in Castagnola's Restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf.  Although he loved the restaurant business, he discovered the difficulty of making efficient, expedient decisions with six partners.  So, with his purchase of a humble café in 1965, Al found an outlet for all the business and life lessons he had learned.  In no time, Al built Scoma's into a landmark restaurant and was always in the front of the house to greet locals, visitors, sports stars, celebrities and anyone who walked through the door. Gracious to all, welcoming guests to his restaurant as he would his home, Al believed that everyone was special and deserved the best food and the best service when they dined at Scoma's.From the beginning, Al forged and nurtured relationships with local fisherman and by 1979, he purchased a 46-foot fishing boat that continues to be used and licensed for the annual salmon and crab seasons.  The local fishermen always knew they had Al's support, whether offering a hot cup of coffee at the restaurant after a hard day's work or purchasing their catch directly.In 1993, with the \"pier to plate\" concept in mind, Al built Scoma's its own fish receiving station.  Dedicated to his brother and co-founder Joe, the station permits public viewing of wild salmon and local Dungeness crab as it is off-loaded from boats and prepared for the kitchen.Newsweek Magazine recognized Scoma's for having one of the best clam chowder recipes in the country (Jan. 10, 2005). And Al was quoted as saying, \"We let our food speak for itself.\"Believing in family being the root of a successful business, Al enlisted daughters, nieces, nephews and, his son-in-law Tom Creedon (who is now President of Scoma's) to build his business and carry on his legacy.  When not at the restaurant, he could be found cheering on his beloved San Francisco Giants and Forty Niners or out on the golf course.  Al Scoma died in June 2007 of natural causes surrounded by his loved ones. He is survived by his three daughters and his wife Cheryl. His name and restaurant continue to be recognized worldwide.Located on Al Scoma Way. Valet parking is fast, simple and smooth. Peak wait time can be up to 30 minutes. Reservations strongly recommended or you can opt to wait at the bar. Impeccable service and amazing attention to detail. Highly recommended. The food is good but the staff is totally off the hook! The grilled calamari is fantastic and the salmon plate is amazing!",
            "Probably our favorite spot among many highlights of a Bay Area vacation. Escape the bubba gump blues of fisherman's wharf, and enter this secluded haven of quality dining and service. You have to find it! It's hidden! But worth it! The decor is classic marina-side dining: wood, glass, and plush. The food is fresh and interesting. We loved the salmon bruschetta and the dungeness crab roll (think north east lobster roll sandwich, but with west coast crab meat). The servers are pros. They know the menu, they know the business of serving, and they are attentive and prompt. A great afternoon lunch!",
            "It smells fishy in here...and I'm not eating any. I've watched Finding Nemo too many times. Life is about comprising and sometimes I have to. My friend likes seafood and I don't. I'm a good friend right? Since I don't eat much seafood I knew my choices would be limited. I can usually find something on the menu at a seafood restaurant because I'm always hungry. I'm not rating them on the seafood but on our overall experience. We ordered: -Truffle fries-Beet salad -Polenta-Bread and butter (complimentary)-Shrimp Alfredo (my friend's dish) We started off with the bread because that's what you do. The bread was hard but I prefer mine warm and soft. If I wasn't so hungry I would have skipped the bread. I personally had to chase down the bread guy to bring us some. He thought he had already brought us some but he only seemed to serve the other tables around us. It wasn't such a big deal however with my limited choices I was looking forward to some bread. I thought the truffle fries were ok at best but the real disappointment of the night was my beet salad. It tasted too healthy, it was like I ordered a plate of just beets. Why even call it a beet salad?  It was not worth the hefty price tag. Lastly, my side of polenta was good but I prefer mine crispy and their polenta had zero crispiness. My friend got the shrimp Alfredo and they modified her order to cater what she wanted. I always appreciate when a restaurant does modifications. I felt like our waiter was just ok, and the price tag didn't match. The service should have been better. Our waiter wasn't rude but he wasn't great. Also, the tables were super close to each other. Who wants to eat listening to other people's conversations, not me. The saddest thing of the night was the desserts.  The choices were limited and I wasn't interested in any. That doesn't happen often. I have too many bookmarks to conquer in San Francisco so I definitely won't be back.",
            "My favorite seafood restaurant to eat at in the Fisherman's Wharf.   Although the price point is going to be significantly more than the restaurants that line the main street, the high quality ingredients and flavor packed dishes make it totally worth it.  Additionally, the restaurants location nestled on the actual pier is an added bonus - you can actually see a loading dock for the restaurant for fresh seafood off fishing boats along the pier.  The inside the restaurant is homey and most seats feature large windows with fishing boats coming in and out of the bay as a scenic backdrop.The 2 dishes we hunt for in SF Fisherman's Wharf are the Dungeness Crab and the Lazy Man's Cioppino.  Scomas is our favorite for both dishes in the area.   The Dungeness Crab is not only super fresh, but the preparation with the roasting and garlic is extra delicious - only wish there was more!  The Lazy Man's Cioppino is packed with seafood and has has great flavor.  It is also not too overly salty like many other places. Other dishes we ordered were the seafood linguine and fresh shucked oysters.  Seafood linguine was expected but not out of this world and the oysters were fresh.  The Dungeness Crab and the Lazy Man's Cioppino are definitely the way to go here.  The crab cakes are probably a close second place.Scomo's continues to be a favorite for many and I believe the quality and service is why it is one of few restaurants in Fisherman's Pier you can see locals versus the throngs of tourists.  On a side note, I did notice a decline in quality of seafood along the main strip during this past visit - especially with the stands along the parking lot.  Seems the restaurants are more focused on grabbing tourists versus establishing repeat business.  Given this, I do think Scomo's distinguishes itself with a higher grade of quality and service and is well worth the visit.",
            "Noooo! No more lobster! My husband and I came back after almost a decade to find they no longer serve lobster here. Our go to was the surf and turf. Swordfish is also gone. I applaud Scoma's for implementing sustainable practices though. Can't be mad at that. Just a sad moment as that dish was what made this place a favorite.Without reservations we waited for about an hour for our table. If you're a small party you might be able to grab a counter height seat at the other end of the bar. Open seating with a TV. You just sacrifice a little privacy. Plus side is you don't have to wait for a table.They have an extensive menu of beer, wine and hard liquor. They offer bread and butter before your meal. The bread wasn't warm though. Truffle fries are good, but could def be improved with some kind of aioli. Crab bisque and clam chowder were both delicious. That clam chowder was the best I've had in awhile. My crab thermidor was good, but my bread was burnt. An item our waiter recommended. Just felt like it was missing something. My husband also enjoyed his wagyu. Overall, an ok meal. Service was excellent as always. Just a note about valet. I thought it was optional, but apparently it's company policy. I'd rather not pay someone to get my car for me especially when it's right in front of the restaurant lol.",
            "No. NO NO NO. I asked if my party of 2 could be moved to a much more couple-friendly and private table but because I had already ordered, they didn't move us. That was their exact reason. And no, there wasn't a wait. Anyway, I ordered the cioppino and yikes. It was AWFUL. I mean, was that ketchup?! Yuck. I had two bites and sent it back. Luckily, krispy creme was open and dinner was dessert. Not complaining about that. Our server at Scoma's was suuuper annoyed about me sending my food back. I'll never understand why anyone would take such a big offense to something like that!! Anyway, that sucked for him because my fiancé and I are excellent tippers (we both work in customer service so we KINDA know what NOT to do) and his response to my distaste for the food brought his tip down. Not like left him high dry but it wasn't as good as it could've been! Anyway, I won't be returning :/Oh! The appetizer was good. Scallops. Order like 5 orders. They're good. Don't get the cioppino.",
            "Nice old fashioned restaurant located on the pier. The server was nice and attentive. The food was heavy in large portions and good. The drinks were strong and left you buzzed. The restaurant was clean. I made a reservation and upon entering despite it being packed our table was ready for us. It was a nice view of the water and good energy.",
            "All these years passing Scoma by and only now have I dined here! What a mistake!Perhaps the intimidation was because parking is limited...but that was put at ease when I saw the valet parking. I'm impressed by the casual, relaxed atmosphere here. If you can get a window table you will not be disappointed!And the food is no disappointment either! The calamari is lightly breaded and sweet...very, very good. I had the halibut on this trip and was amazed at how fresh the fish was...tender, flaky, a down-right pleasure to eat.I had no room for anything else even as I was tempted to have more. Indeed, Scoma's feels like a hidden gem of the San Francisco Bay Area. Glad I finally ate here!",
            "We enjoyed our pre dinner drinks and meal here on a Friday night.We had the crab thermador and appetizer trio for 2.   The crab was definitely the star, very rich and satisfying.  The appetizer, which included calamari, crab cakes, and bacon wrapped scallops were just okay.  The crab cakes were a total disappointment, very dry and flavorless.  Attentive service, prices are what you would expect at the wharf.",
            "Took too long to provide table service.  Not sure if the gentleman handling the section with the view had too many tables or if they thought I did not have money to eat there.  Came in dressed casual, as I had just finished doing a tour.  From previous reviews I read, customers can dress casual or dressy.   Maybe there was another reason why I was not greeted or given water within 15 minutes of being seated.  No worries, there are plenty of other restaurants on the warf with fresh seafood.",
            "I am at the restaurant right now. I could not wait. I am in San Francisco for the first time and have been trying some different restaurants.  I wanted to try a San Fran staple, Ciopino. I did a little research and spoke to some good friends. Scoma They are a restaurant and a fish market all in one. The shops are outside to prove it. Che k out the video on the website to watch the journey I started with the calamari friti. Very light and oh so fresh. Everything is wonderfully fresh throughout. Not oily or doughy. If anything the outside was understated.  I then moved to the Ciopino. Swordfish, scallops, Dungeness crab, shrimp ( one shell and the tails) scallops, squid, clams, and muscles. I paired it with a nice Pinot and the sauce had just the right amount of heat.  The bread that came along with it should be on the menu by itself. I'm going to check. Buttered and toasted crisp! I finished with a homemade canoli that I can only describe as refreshing. The marscapone was not overly sweet and the orange was great. The pine nuts added some flavors but I don't think they were very necessary. A wonderful meal that I would not mind doing again next time I am in San Francisco. It's a bit pricey but the flavor and quality of the fish helps you get over it.",
            "I would give this resto 4 stars but they failed in a couple areas on my last visit.Lets talk about the good stuff first.Pros:Free parking which is unheard of in sf!!!!Cute ambience.Large-ish bars.Semi private tables bc of how its sectioned offServers and valet are courteous.Their private label cab is good.Cons:Had to wait almost an hr more bc we were 30mins late....it was pouring rain on Christmas eve. SmhWe even called them earlier to give them a heads up but it didnt matter.The steak isnt so good. Good thing there isnt much of it. Also note its pre cut.",
            "This is officially my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. For years my dad raves about how good it was but I never went. And boy do I wish I had tried it earlier. First of all, Scoma's knows how to make a fantastic cocktail. The smoked maple old fashioned I ordered was easily the best I have ever had. My boyfriend got a Manhattan that was also great. Their drinks are on the expensive side but the bars here would be a great place to start a special night. They have an old fashioned flight that I am definitely trying the next time I come.Now the food... it's also fantastic. I got the cioppino and loved it. My only complaint was that the shrimp and some of the fish was over cooked. I should have expected that in a soup but it was disappointing nonetheless. I also tried a bite of the scallops and it was amazing. It melted in my mouth and was cooked to perfection. It makes a difference to use fresh, quality ingredients, and Scoma's knows how to cook them too! We also got the cannoli for dessert. It was not very sweet so it was not too well received by our group. But it was probably very authentic and too refined for our sugar-craving American palettes.  Lastly, the service was also incredible. Our server was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. He was very professional. It's what you would expect from a higher end restaurant.I will definitely be back to Scoma's for my next special occasion in SF.",
            "Whoa! Hello!This has been on our date night / let's just be foodies list for 4 years. I have no idea why we haven't been here. There was a mention of me being lactose sensitive and it narrowing where we can go :( BUT, we finally made it here and it was a double date. Guys, this place is amazing to go alone and catch a glimpse of amazing bay food, go on a date, go with a friend, go for a work lunch with some colleagues, or a double date and more! I don't know but I love it here. It is a hidden little getaway in a little alley way. There isn't much parking but you can always park elsewhere and use nearby transits to come by! I find that the best option. Walking down Fisherman's Wharf is always fun - there's just so many places to swing by and check out. The food you get is from their own catch off the pier so it's as fresh as you can get, really. Our friends got the Caprese Salad and soup. I didn't catch a picture of their soup so I don't remember what it is but they thoroughly enjoyed their meal! We got the dungeness crab cocktail and the lazy man's cioppino! Oh, my goodness, y'all will not believe just how simply divine it is. It simply soothes your soul to dip bread into the cioppino and eat the little clams. I have no idea what my favorite part is but believe that I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Service - in short, is top notch. Simply, genuine, helpful people there to assist you in the best dining experience possible. 10/10 would recommend.",
            "IMHOScoma's is my favorite seafood restaurant-of- choice in San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf!  This quaint SF iconic establishment is nestled a short walk down Al Scoma Way on Pier 47.  My family is blessed to be invited for an annual birthday luncheon always held at Scoma's, the birthday girl's favorite restaurant!Their seafood is the freshest I've ever tasted, purchased right off the boat, steps away from the kitchen!  The calamari appetizer ($17) is perfectly tender and crispy.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  I  usually order the petrale dor'e ($32) served with the most flavorful rice pilaf and sauteed green beans and carrots.  The rest of our fam ordered the Wild \"troll-caught\" Salmon ($43), \"Line-caught\" Wild Cod ($35), and \"Lazy Man's \" Cioppino ($42).  Service is always exemplary and stellar here!Chris is our favorite waiter! Trust me, you will never be sorry you chose to dine at Scoma's!",
            "We wanted to try some fresh seafood, I looked on the Yelp app and this place had so many reviews on it so I gave it a try. The seafood is so fresh that it comes from the fisherman's boat right to your plate . It's a rustic looking place that sits right on the Bay. I started with the fresh raw oysters followed by a cup of New England clam chowder which was seasoned perfectly. Then I went with our waiters advice and had the seafood combo plate which came with the fresh fish of the day with salmon and shrimp,all cooked just right and tender. The waiter was very attentive and was there always filling are wine glass.It is a popular restaurant in town, but it is a little pricey.Not much parking down by the pier, so suggest taking the trolley,uber or lyft.",
            "This is our favorite seafood restaurant to eat at in the Fisherman's Wharf.     Additionally, you can actually see a loading dock for the restaurant for fresh seafood off fishing boats.  You feel at home when you are inside the restaurant. Almost all seats have large windows with fishing boats coming in and out of the bay as a scenic backdrop. They have high prices comparing to the ones on the main street but their high quality ingredients worth it.Our server was friendly, attentive. What you would expect from a higher end restaurant.I will definitely be back to Scoma's for my next trip to SF.",
            "Tucked away along San Francisco Bay and across a bridge from the busy Fisherman's Wharf. This iconic place serves the freshest seafood, awesome water view, eclectic menu and great service.What to order? Scoma is known for their \"pier to plate\" menu. I personally enjoyed the Gulf Shrimp Lumachini made with sea shell pasta, fresh herbs, garlic and gremolata this pasta dish is perfectly seasoned topped with sautéed wild gulf shrimp. Definitely try the Scoma's famous clam chowder. Creamy, rich and packed with seafood goodness. Feeling undecided? or maybe you would like to sample a little bit of everything? try the Fried Combo Platter. Elizabeth is a sweet lady and we enjoyed chatting with her. It is nice coming to a restaurant feeling sincerely welcomed.",
            "Man I can't believe I haven't given Scoma's credit yet! This is my special night out, my \"I'm going to be fancy tonight\" dinner. Also, it's my parents favorite restaurant in the city so every time they come out to visit me, we pay Scoma's a visit. This place does not go easy on the wallet, so be prepared. Nestled away from the main street, it can be hard to find. You won't see it when you're driving, but look out for one Scoma's sign that points to the back. I always order the \"Lazy Man's Cioppino\" and man is it amazing. Literally one of the best Cioppino's I've ever tried, it keeps my whole family coming back. The Fritto Misto (fried Calamari) is to die for, literally you can't go wrong with anything you order here. Scoma's, you have my heart. You're doing seafood right."

It's nice because you are off the high traffic areas and get a moment to sit down and eat. I'm sure during the week it's packed. Prices are your typical SF rates, around $10+ depending on what you add? Creative Grilled Cheeses you can order. I love their hot sauce, became so obsessed that I looked up where they sell it. Palo Alto Fire Fighters Hot Sauce.They have a fictional bathroom. Families are encouraged to dine here. We came with 2 little kids. I would go back.",
            "Meehhh pretty basic Not bad but certainly not remarkable.  I ordered the club not a big fan of the arugula on the sandwich. Even without it MeehhhhLooking at the reviews I probably should have gone with the jalapeño popper sandwich with bacon? The lady at the front counter was really nice!",
            "What does it say about me as a human being -- as an American! -- that my very favorite restaurant happens to feature grilled cheese as its primary dish? I shall leave aside that relevant question for now and focus solely on how totally freaking awesome this particular version of America's favorite sandwich is. WOW! I always get the mousetrap -- the Platonic ideal of a grilled cheese. It's elemental -- just bread and cheese and deliciousness. My nephew went big -- got a grilled cheese with macaroni and cheese. Friendly staff, totally clean operation, help yourself to water (a perk I always enjoy, but especially in this environment of soda taxes and sales taxes). This is that rare restaurant for which a magical sixth star should be an option, both to reward its awesomeness and also to offset the jerks and meanies who give it one star for no good reason (or for obnoxious reasons). Like how about this one: \"the food is too expensive.\" Read the newspaper! Small businesses in San Francisco -- throughout California, actually -- are getting KILLED by regulations and pass-along costs. You can't turn around and blame the place that's struggling to employ people!!! OK, rant over, back to the matter at hand. Which is that AGCK is amazing and everyone should eat there.",
            "Perfect size grilled cheese stuffed with amazing Mac n cheese! I added bacon and lettuce. Every bite the cheese oozed out.I love that it's on sourdough bread because it adds another layer of flavor! And the bread was a perfect medium brown, crunch but lightly toasted.I was craving this and it definitely fulfilled my craving. Perfection!",
            "Ok - not bad. Had the Avocado Toast, something I could do at home. I actually like the Melt better, had more creative selections. The place was clean, service was okay (a little air headish). Orange juice looks fresh squeezed but is not. I am going to have to try other selection in the menu in order to get a fair evaluation of this place.",
            "Heavy. If I could sum up my experience here in one word it would be heavy. I got the mac and cheese grilled cheese, which I believe is served on a buttered sourdough. The mac and cheese had such a rich creamy flavor, and I love that it is baked. When I am alone at home, I will often ladle mac and cheese onto my hot dogs and sandwiches, so it was nice that someone was willing to do it for me. Also don't judge, you know you're going to add 'mac and cheese' to the condiment rack next time you have a cookout. You're welcome.Aside from the delicious mac and cheese, the service here is fantastic. This place has a lot of pull around lunch time, but they keep the line moving quickly, and the two ladies that were holding down front of house on the days I have visited are always nice and friendly.The downside here is that you really are paying a lot ($12+) for a grilled cheese. It is difficult to justify beyond just the occasional \"treat yo self\" moments. At the end of the day it isn't a lot of food, and I always end up supplementing it with something else (a granola bar or a protein shake, but my cravings can become dangerous). Which brings me to my next point; it isn't a lot of food, but it is heavy. It has seriously negative effects on your health and in real time. I feel like I breath heavier, move slower, sleep immediately on days when I have had one of these bad boys. Which is fine, but I'd like to at least feel full, ya know?Anyway, treat yo self and grab one of these next time you're jonesing for some comfort food. Just try not to fall in love.",
            "I picked this place on a recommendation from a colleague who was raving about the food. The food is really good - and on taste alone I would give at LEAST 4*. I know we're in SF, but $11 for a small sandwich is not cool guys. I ordered a Mac and cheese grill, and a tomato soup. The soup had a little spicy kick to it, which was a lovely surprise. The sandwich was perfectly crispy and seasoned really well. The portions however are super small so I didn't feel it was great value for money. Saying that, the service is really friendly and the branding and packaging are great (if that kind of thing matters to you). I wouldn't visit again unless the prices were significantly reduced, but if you've got cash to burn, go for it!",
            "Listen up!  I was about to experience the best happy hour of my entire life but I was sadly mistaken. A few colleagues and I decided to take a stroll to The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen for their 2 cookies and milk Happy Hour. I walked in so excited to nibble on a cookie with friends and have a nice cold glass of milk. After being handed a fragile stale cookie, I opened my carton of Crystal 2% white milk and took a large swig to wash down the crusty crumbs of the cookie that could barely make it down my throat. The stench hit me and it was already too late. The milk tasted like actual stomach acid, and to my dismay was 3 days expired. It took every bit of willpower in me to not cry in front of my colleagues. Not only was the milk expired, but the muffins too. My colleague was quickly told she couldn't take the last cookie and was handed a dusty muffin as collateral for her purchase. This is when we all started feeling physically uncomfortable from our purchase and visit to The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen. On top of all of this, the coffee was filled to the brim with grinds. I will not be returning, thank u next.",
            "For our weekly office lunch, I decided to get my main course from The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen. (I ordered a salad from another spot as my appetizer.) Our delivery order arrived by Caviar on Friday, February 2nd around 12:30pm.I wanted a cheesy sandwich with meat, so I decided to get the Club Turkey: Cheddar, creamy havarti, Willie Bird smoked turkey, seasoned tomatoes, stout mustard, arugula, and on sourdough ($11). I wanted something comforting and melty, but unfortunately this didn't totally fulfill that craving. It either needed more cheese or less meat and veggies. I didn't get that comforting melty bite I wanted. Though if I was looking for just a hot sandwich, this might have fit the bill.I normally order the mushroom sandwich, so that's probably more up my alley when I want a nice ooey gooey sandwich. The Club Turkey just had too much going on. Overall, A-OK.",
            "I got the Red, White, and Blue plate with tomato soup and half a mac n cheese grilled cheese sandwich. Overall, everything was freshly made in-house, the portion was filling, and the service was friendly. I thought the food was fine but not as good as I'd hoped.  It's probably just my personal preference, but I like tomato soup to be a little chunkier and AGCK's is thinner. It did come with lots of croutons on the side, so that helped. The grilled cheese was so-so as well. The mac n cheese was not as cheesy as I'd hope and definitely needed some seasoning. They didn't skimp on the amount of mac for it being a half sandwich, but I just wish the flavor were there. I will note that the sourdough bread held up the sandwich well and it didn't get soggy at all. I think some salt/pepper or hot sauce would've helped the grilled cheese be more robust. For $12, the quality is there, but the value, not quite.",
            "Food is good. Ordering and sitting for 45 mins without food isn't. You wasted my lunch break. I would give it zero stars if I could.Also, I had a gift card to use and their system doesn't have a scanner so there's no real way to process it. They took the number down for it, but don't issue something you can't process!!I came here on my lunch break at 11:30am to beat the crowd. Only 2 people sitting in the entire place and I was helped immediately. I order the Red, White, and Blue Plate Special with the Club Turkey and the Bamboo Kale Salad. I also ordered some garlic fries. The fries came out almost immediately. Great start. The fries need more garlic though, they just taste like normal fries. Here's where my experience goes downhill. We sit around for 20 mins no food, then 30 mins, no food, FINALLY at 45 mins, I walk up to ask them about my meal and can they please box it up bc my lunch break is over. It still takes them another 5-10 mins to get my food. HOW DOES IT TAKE ALMOST AN HOUR TO MAKE ME 1/2 A GRILLED CHEESE AND A SALAD??? Meanwhile, the kicker is that EVERYONE who's come in and ordered to go or from one of the meal services has gotten their food and left. 45 mins is not okay to sit around for half a grilled cheese and salad and the fact that no one even cared we were waiting 45 mins is crazy. Not impressed.",
            "OK. Nothing special about it. Sandwiches are not freshly made which was a huge bummer (per an employee when I asked to modify a sandwich) but lemonade is good.",
            "So stoked that they're in the neighborhood-- I work at one of the many ad agencies nearby and HR occasionally uses em when we're hosting clients. Yes, I shamelessly lurk for untouched lunchboxes when the clients are on their way out. Anyway, when I'm not mooching off of the company dime I try to make it into this place for what is arguably the best breakfast sando in the city. Around lunch I actually gravitate toward their salads more often than not just cuz they're sizeable and I don't feel like I'm eating totally unhealthily. Everything else is solid in there. Folks are friendly behind the counter. The place has character. And it's a locally owned business. In closing, fuck the Melt. Who goes to a VC funded fast food place anyway? Ridiculous.",
            "I love this restaurant, great food and a wonderful owner who cares about his restaurant. I was a little confused about the last visit. After I went again to eat today I was amazed at how great the food was. Last visit was a little off, but this time the new manager made sure my order was up to par. This time I ordered brussel sprouts and really liked them. The garlic fries are off the hook good. Best advice I can offer about the AGCK is to bring your appetite, the portions are large and filling. I also really like the jalepeno popper sandwich and the Mac and cheese on grilled cheese. Also, the best tomato soup with Mexican sour cream. I love to dip my sandwiches into the soup.",
            "The food here isn't bad - solid 3 stars (a quality grilled cheese).But nothing of this quality warrants a 45 minute wait nor the accompanying price tag.Gourmet grilled cheese for sure, but unless this is REALLY your thing - go elsewhere.",
            "Delicious grilled cheese. Every sandwich cooked to order.  Why go to MELT?  I much rather eat the creative combinations made here with the delicious sourdough bread.  Yum!",
            "Came here to use the restroom, so I asked him if they had soda.  Surprisingly, they don't have soda! I got their strawberry lemonade and it was on the sour side. So if you like it on the sour side, you should try it out. I'll be back to try their food. It smelled delicious in there.",
            "I had the Cubano and Mac and Cheese Grilled Cheese and Garlic Fries (3 visits, not in one sitting LOL)Food is good no doubt about that cuz who doesn't love cheese in their sandwich with some garlic fries. In my opinion it is expensive for specialty sandwiches for an ok portion size. I spent $20 for garlic fries and a sandwich (fries come separately).",
            "The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen is another chain restaurant specializing in grilled cheese in FiDi. I like grilled cheese so I decided to try it out a couple of days ago. I ordered online directly through their website and decided to get the Red White & Blue Plate Special which is a small size grilled cheese with a soup or salad. I went with the Smokey Tomato soup and Mac & Cheese grilled cheese ($.92) for a total of ($10.60). After ordering I landed up after about 15 minutes as this place is a little far from the downtown lunch circuit.Upon entering I saw that there were a lot of people waiting for their food. Unfortunately I could not find any sign for online order pickup, so I had to stand in the normal ordering line. This is like the 100th place in FiDi that does not have a simple sign for directing people who order online. What is the point of ordering online and then having to stand in line again? Anyway, thankfully my order was ready and I was on my way.What I got was a fancy box with a tiny burnt Mac and cheese grilled cheese sandwich (see the picture that I've uploaded). It was really a snack size portion that was tasteless as it lacked proper seasoning. This would qualify as the perfect specimen to portray for bad grilled cheese sandwich. The tomato soup on the other hand was pretty good.Price wise this was almost 50% more expensive when compared to The Melt, the other specialized grilled cheese place in FiDi with the quality of sandwich being half that of The Melt. Sorry not impressed, so not planning on making a return visit.",
            "I order off the menu, not like a d**k though, burgers at a chicken joint, that's...ILLing, but items that are in the menu in a different way. The menu at TAGK is VERY tempting, but today I wanted fries with my eggs. Order the 3 eggs over garlic fries with a rasher of bacon and enjoy! Breakfast ends at 1100hours during the week."

            "Great experience here. We came the week it opened so it was busy with even a wait on Friday at 1030pm. However, the staff was extremely generous and we could tell they were working hard to get us seated. We waited in the bar where we were served generous pours. Once we got our table the waitress was so helpful going into extreme detail regarding which salads to choose and she heavily recommended the wings.The picture doesn't look like much but they were mouth-watering. Cooked perfect, great flavor, very unique. The salad was a bit too salty for our liking but i feel it was the style given the anchovy. Still ate it all - though this may have been where I would deduct .5 from my score. We also ordered pizza which was great. I don't think you can go wrong with fiorella pizza of any type. A definite repeat. Great add to the neighborhood (and replacement).",
            "I was so excited for this to open in the neighborhood, Russian Hill needs more good eats.I made reservations and when I got there, the restaurant was packed. I was seated right by the door. Servers and customers knocking into my me. Plus it was freezing, so do not sit by that one table near the host station/door. Aside from that, service was slow. We sat there for about 15 mins and no one gave us water or even say hi. I know they were slammed but still. Ordered: **Nono's Meatballs - the sauce was super yummy. **Bucatini alla Pomodoro - needed more flavor, my friend did not like it as well. Wasted calories one would say. Presentation was awful. Sauce all over the bowl, inside and out. Seems like they just threw pasta into it and didn't care. **Clam Pie - the crust was so good, thin and light, just the way I like my pizzas. Can't taste much clam but it was still tasty. **Stracciatella Semifreddo - first time having it, not bad. Ice cream kinda of bar/fudge texture. Overall food was ok, service was nice but slow. I will hopefully come back and hope things get better. But I am excited to try their brunch when they start offering it.",
            "Came in for Fiorella for dinner, luckily it was on open table, upon hearing the hype in the richmond district. The ambience was very mediocre. There was no enough space for people to walk so whenever someone walked by we would always have to move our seat to let them by. Secondly, there is a funky smell while entering which should be fixed immediately.The food it self met expectations. I would definitely come back for their pasta and pizza! As for the service however, it took almost 20 minutes to bring our dessert our! I believe this is due to new staff. I am sure as time goes on they will get better.I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a romantic date spot if you live near by.",
            "New neighborhood spot was lit. Ordered the octopus, beet salad, spicy salami pie and the cacio e Pepe. Beet salad takes home the crown, followed by the cacio e pepe pasta. Insider tip -  very generous wine pours!",
            "What a lovely new addition to Polk Street! The pizza is fire, the staff is fire, and the drank is fire. I snagged some food and was happy as a pizza pie. This place is next door to my gym, so I can easily grab some post-workout bites, or simply skip the workout and grub out.Notable must-trys are the New Haven and Cacio e pepe. Love the wine and beer selection as well. My girlfriend loves the dessert too. Even the simple Margherita was delicious. Ugh I wish I could eat this pizza all the time. PERFECT LOCATION FOR DATE NIGHT!My only complaint is that things are a bit pricey. $20 for a pie that isn't super filling is a bit steep.",
            "Yikes a 1 and 1/2 hour wait for this?! I haven't been this disappointed in a restaurant since I waited three hours for a back seat table at State Bird. I'm hoping my disappointment is opening jitters as I've been told the Richmond location is \"amazing\".  We ordered the baby lettuce salad, chicken wings and burrata pizza. The highlight was the salad. The chicken wings were just bad (how do you mess up fried food?) and the pizza was meh at best. The service was great so I'm  hoping this is an isolated incident that we can chalk up to new restaurant issues, but the 5 stars I'm seeing are incomprehensible.",
            "I always try to stop in when I'm in the Bay area.  The meatballs are epic!   You have to get them.  Wish they came.with bread but hey...you can't always get what you want.  Service is great and the staff is really kind.  Go after 8pm to avoid a wait!",
            "This is my favorite Italian restaurant in the city. Of course, the fresh pasta is a must, but don't miss the beef cheeks, calzone and stracciatella. Fiorella is a really cool spot with all the Bay Area vibes (check out the wallpaper), great for dates and event better family-style meals or event to have a solo drink.",
            "I love the Richmond location and was super excited when they opened in my neighbourhood.I am from Rome and I LOVE pizza! and good ones are hard to find. Fiorella's pizza is really good. My three srars are for 1. Service: sat at bar,which I like, but girl was pretty much ignoring me all time.I asked a question about the menu , she looked at me as if I was from another planet (my question was about a salad, clarifying if it was the original roman recipe). It then took forever to take my plates away or even asking if I didnt anything. 2.Pizzas are great, rest of things on menu not so much. I appreciate the creative take on classic dishes (and that we are not in Italy,,) but those supplis are not supplis!! Still will go back for the pizza.",
            "I was super excited about the opening of an Italian restaurant down the street from my house, but unfortunately it was a huge letdown. As many others have pointed out, the service is slow, disconnected, and misguided. You expect better from any restaurant in this city, but especially one that is charging $75 for a shared dinner for two. The food wasn't bad, hence the two stars, but I won't be back anytime soon. I hope they get some better restaurant management to improve their service and succeed.",
            "Fiorella, you're cracking my heart wide open. I've been here three times since you guys have opened. I love the Burrata pie. The pasta is delicious. The cocktails are the perfect level of sweetness. I love sitting at the bar in the dim coziness of the restaurant late at night. But tonight... we were looking to bring some food back to the house so we could drink wine with friends. We ordered pickup, and were instructed to come in 30 minutes. We arrived promptly, and ended up shuffling foot to foot for 15 minutes while the order was prepared. That was fine--I get that you guys are super busy on a Saturday night. But the kicker: when we got home, the pizza (sadly very cold, even though we live 10 minutes away) was missing the key ingredient: burrata. The burrata, as you might imagine, is the focal point of the burrata pizza. :( We called and were told, whoops, the burrata must have been forgotten. Because the whole experience had already taken so long, we opted to not go back (it was already almost 10 PM, and an expected 20 minute trip had taken over 40 minutes). The entire order was $60+--I really just don't expect this level of service from a nice and pretty expensive restaurant. Currently shedding tears over my chocolate budino. :(",
            "Very very salty pizza. Very expensive given that it's also expensive for pizza. I expected a more balanced flavor",
            "Loved this place. Same vibe as the original with amazing food and drinks. Great atmosphere for a date night or with friends. Lambrusco is spot on, meatballs are a must along with the rice balls and the calzone to share! Will be back!",
            "Be sure to make a reservation because the wait was pretty long! The wings are very unique and I loved them. Also, the ginger beer here is my new favorite!",
            "So I went here on a Friday night- wait was 1 hour at 6 PM without reservation. They do have one communal table and bar for open seating. THIS PLACE WAS SOOOO GOOD! the waitress was amazing she was so fast took our order immediately and I forgot I had waited an hour hungry lol. The burrata pizza-AMAZING. The pasta and beef cheeks were also so good. I loved the butter salad, so fresh. You could really tell everything was homemade. The pasta was perfectly done. Honestly plan to come here ALL the time as I just loved down the street.",
            "Fiorella- Polk is such a great addition to Russian Hill neighborhood. I love Fiorella on Clement and the Polk location did not disappoint. I loved the citrus salad and the calzone. The pizzas are great. My friend had beef cheeks and loved the dish. I love the vibe of the restaurant.",
            "so happy to have this spot open again in the neighborhood. happy that you guys are busy already, happy to see familiar gioia faces. everything was delicious and i can't wait to be a regular again!"

            "I was in San Francisco for business and needed to take someone for lunch for an interview. This place was near our office and was recommended by a colleague, so I gave it a try.it was a little chaotic at lunch time, so I was glad I had made a reservation. They sat us relatively quickly at a table right near the bar. Not ideal, but it worked. The other issue was that it was really loud, which made it difficult to have a conversation.I didn't love the choices on the menu, but I was able to find a few things that sounded OK. Our server was very nice and our food was brought out very promptly. I had the Dungeness Crab Sandwich. The bread crust was a little tough, bit other than that it was pretty tasty.",
            "A great under-the-radar happy hour spot! Happy hour is offered Mon-Fri 3-6 pm and includes a good selection of food and cocktails. All of their cocktails, regularly priced at $13, are $9 during happy hour.My friend and I made a reservation for 5:30 on a Friday and the restaurant was pretty empty when we walked in. Our server started out by bringing us bread and complimentary garlic potato chips and spiced nuts. The bread is really soft, but the butter is pretty salty so use it sparsely.They had 3 daily pizzas available for happy hour. We went the margherita for $14. It's thin crust, probably 10-12 inches, and great for 2-3 people to share.We also ordered the brussel sprouts ($7). They were delicious with the pancetta, though I would've liked for sprouts to be more crispy and less soft.As far as drinks go, I started off with the Jamaican Breeze (rum, pressed pineapple, lime, vanilla), which tasted like pineapple juice, i.e. it was nice and sweet. I also ordered the Maryunez (yuzu infused gin, sweet vermouth, maraschino, bitters) as well, but I didn't like it as much because it was very strong on the gin and I couldn't taste any yuzu or cherry flavors which I was expecting. I had to slowly sip on this.The service here is great! Our server was very attentive in checking in with us occasionally, and my water glass was never empty for long. We were here for 3.5 hours slowly drinking and chatting and there was absolutely no pressure to leave. I really appreciated that.",
            "Came here on a rainy night with reservations for 7:30.  The place was packed and our table wasn't ready so we grabbed a drink at the bar.  We ended up having to wait 30 minutes but the hostess was extremely apologetic and our drinks at the bar were comped, so no big deal.  We split the meatballs, I had the lemon pasta, and my bf had the sedanini.  GET THE SEDANINI.  It looks like a giant pasta souffle and it's steamy and comforting and warm and delicious.  Service was good and I enjoyed my meal here.  I'd come back!",
            "Had the Roasted Chicken Breast, thigh involtino, vegetables fregola, natural jus and it was delicious.  The chicken breast was tasty and juicy - all the way though.  The involtino was rich and flavorful.  The service was pleasant and the sound was lively but not enough to distract the lunch.  Good job.",
            "Impressed with the food here. We came here on a Friday around 5pm and were told that they were all booked for the evening but that we could sit at the bar. The restaurant was completely empty, so we wandered over to the bar and sat down. We ordered a few drinks to start, and then had the brussel sprouts, meatballs, caesar salad (ended up getting a second order of this), papardelle and burrata. The food came out relatively fast, but in weird spurts. The brussel sprouts and meatballs came out at the same time, but then there was a weird 5-10 minute gap between that and the caesar salad. We opted to order another caesar at this point, so the paparadelle came out, then the other caesar arrived before the burrata even had a chance to make an appearance.The food was good, but I thought it was slightly overpriced. The caesar for example, was delicious, but probably only came with about 5-6 pieces of butter lettuce. All in all, this place was tasty but with the standard of food so high in a place like San Francisco, it didn't stand out from some of the others by much.",
            "We came here for team lunch and the foods are pretty good overall. I enjoyed their Brussels sprouts, the meat balls, and their burrata. I ordered their lemon butter crab fettuccine as my entrees, the only complaint about this entree is too greasy!! The texture of the pasta and flavors are good except too oily which makes it too heavy and fatty. My team enjoyed their foods too. Overall this place is a pretty good Italian restaurant and I'd like to come back already.",
            "We came here during lunch time and the service was just wonderful. At first I ordered a steak salad but didn't like it much, the waiter was kind enough to let me place another order for free. I ended up ordering a crab sandwich that ended up being really yummy :)",
            "Loved my experience at Credo so much, and I can't wait to go back! Portion sizes are quite large, so be mindful of how much you order. Burrata, Octopus, and Chicken are all incredibly delicious. Loved the presentation of the Rigatoni in a pizza bowl. Cocktails are also great. Definitely a pricey meal but well worth it for service, food, and quality",
            "I know have a new place to enjoy Happy Hour whenever I happen to be walking the streets of San Francisco's Financial District. Credo serves delectable Italian inspired bites in a sleek modern setting that even featured quotes from celebrities from politics to sports of what they \"believe\" in. My friend wanted to go out for a bit of a pub crawl \"Happy Hour\" style and we settled on eventually landing at Credo and we were not disappointed with our decision thanks to the amount of food you receive and the Happy Hour pricing of their libations, we learned it was well worth a visit. What initially had us was the 9 dollar cocktails for Happy Hour, which is a savings of four dollars, and happens weekdays from 3-6 pm. We didn't have any reservations and when we arrived at about 5:30 pm they were super slammed and we were lucky to be sat at two available seats at the bar which with plenty of white marble was sleek and sophisticated. My friend ordered the Huckleberry Punch made with Square One basil vodka, huckleberry, lemon, and ginger beer, while I ordered the C & C made with Nolet's gin, cucumber, lime and cilantro. I sipped my friends punch and it was a sultry red cocktail, while my cocktail was a refreshing green cocktail that provided that certain spicy kick reminiscent of a green cosmo, if that's even possible!The real star at Credo is their afternoon bites menu (i.e. their Happy Hour food menu) which like the drinks is served weekdays from 3-6 pm. We loved our Garlic Potato Chips which are served complimentary to every table, which is a nice change from bread or nuts. Everything looked so good on their bites menu that we ordered most of it, including the Pork & Ricotta Meatballs served with Polenta, Roasted Potatoes served with sweet onions and an herb aioli dipping sauce, the Crostini served with fresh ricotta, local figs and a healthy dousing of villa manodori balsamic vinegar, and the Burrata served with roasted beets, saba, and plenty of toasted levain bread. While the meatballs and potatoes were solid options, the real finds were the crostini and the fresh figs and the burrata and bread dishes, both of which were full meals in their own right. Both prepared with a lot of flavor and intricate care, the fact we were saving as much as three dollars on one dish and five dollars only added to our enjoyment of what was supposed to a quick bite turned out to be a full meal. I would indeed return to Credo to enjoy a full meal or a quick bite at the bar, which even on Fridays tends to empty out at an even clip. There is even a private dining room downstairs by the restroom with its own private bar called \"The Archive,\" which only adds to the mystery of what Credo is all about. I noticed on their dinner menu that the pasta entrees averaged about 25 dollars and the fish and meat main entrees averaged about 35 dollars, which in downtown San Francisco is more than a reasonable price point. A fun and casual yet still elegant dining destination among all the financial institutions in downtown with a great Happy Hour? Consider me sold!",
            "Awesome appetizers, entree and drinks! All you need is good company! :) Definitely going back for HH again!",
            "Credo reminds me of the lunch fare at Perbacco, which is a good thing.  The food is really good here.  I enjoyed the pea soup and the meatball appetizer, and the tater tots and kettle chips are just so awesome.  I recommend Credo for a casual or business lunch.",
            "A friend picked this place for our catching up dinner. The food was excellent! And I really enjoyed the reclaimed wood tables and the \"I believe\" quotes. They both added to the unique atmosphere.The octopus starter was my favorite but all the dishes were delicious. The service was friendly and helpful (the server will offer her suggestions if you're overwhelmed with choice).",
            "Fantastic lunch spot. Quotes all over the walls make for a superior dining atmosphere. The shrimp salad was fantastic, with crisp lettuce unlike any I've had before. Yum!",
            "Came to San Francisco to check out the new transit mall and meet up with our son. Credo was very close to all. I have been doing the WFPB aka vegan eating for some time now. I contacted the restaurant through the Yelp app and the responded fast. They mentioned about 4 items off the menu and said other items could be tweaked too.When we arrived Brandon greeted us and confirmed that we had a vegan in our party.The menu was not over whelming, drinks on one side and food the other.I ordered the zucchini papparadelle for the table to share, it was thinly sliced zucchini, tomatoes, squash blossoms and garlic. I could eat that one all day.For my main dish I had the pizza with no cheese and add mushrooms.I was going to add more info about ingredients on pizza but was unable to access the menu on line.The wife had a burrata cheese and shrimp dish.Son had a salad that had strawberry in it and a pasta dish that was covered with pizza dough. Both were happy with selections.We were to full for desertAlso, our waiter was great to explain how the dishes were prepared and ingredients.",
            "I enjoyed a nice dinner at Credo this past weekend (5/19/18). Four of us gathered for an early meal and found the restaurant  to be very pleasant since it was quiet enough to hold a conversation.What I liked about Credo was the fact that there were a lot of food options for any appetite and craving. Bonus: the restaurant starts you off with delicious complimentary levain bread & butter.After reading other Yelp reviews I decided we should start off with the octopus plate as our shared appetizer. Gotta say that not only was the plate very pretty to look at but also incredibly tasty. Definitely I could have had this all to myself as an entree since the vegetables, potatoes and octopus together was delicious.My companions (who all seemed focused on carbo loading) ordered pastas: pappardelle with pork sugo, linguine & clams and cavatelli with chicken breast. They seemed happy with their dishes and gobbled up the pasta in record time.My choice of pork chop as entree, unfortunately, was the only disappoint. The meat was undercooked and was quite pink near the bone so I couldn't eat it. Otherwise the accompanying sides of sauteed red cabbage (somewhat sauerbraten-like) and disks of baked/ grilled sweet potato were yummy.Since one of our party was celebrating a birthday, we were about to order dessert but were pleasantly surprised when our server brought out a slice of cake with a lit candle on a plate. How thoughtful & what a nice surprise! The cake was a house-made cherry blossom essence sponge cake with whip cream on the side. Very light and was a good way to round out the meal.Overall, I liked Credo restaurant. The decor was very pretty; the quiet weekend ambiance relaxing for the group; and food was satisfying. Hope to return to try other dishes in the future.Btw: Credo in Italian means \"I believe\" and this is the start of all the quotes on the artfully designed wall space.",
            "Had the King Salmon there and it was amazing. Salmon was done properly. I think the quinoa on the top are fried which add crunches to it. The jalapeno was surprisingly pleasant. The blue prawns were ridiculously good. After finishing the prawns, we dipped bread into the sauce and I think I can honestly eat that combo every meal -- just the bread and the sauce lmao.Crab fettuccine was packed with flavor too... I don't think any dish could disappoint me but I guess that comes with the price.",
            "Came here with a friend for lunch and it was overall okay.Food wise, the burrata was phenomenal! The combination of sweet and savory was just delicious. 10/10 recommend! I ordered the tomatoes and cucumber salad with yogurt (starter) and it was okay. I wouldn't order it again. As for our main dishes, I had the salmon and I was not super impressed. The top coat garnish was good, gave it a lot of flavor. But the rest of the salmon was just \"eh\". The beans and veggies that came under the salmon were also okay, the sauce in which they were cooked with was okay as well. My friend ordered the halibut and he said it was now the second time he'd ordered it, it was really good according to him. Looked good!We both got a taste of a white wine the waiter suggested (cannot remember the name) and it was really really good. I've yet to find a white wine that I really like as I'm a red wine kind of gal, but this one was definitely a good one! I remember the waiter mentioning it was from the north of Italy, a little town which had the name on the bottle. Now the service. The service was great! Our waiter was super kind, very attentive and knew his recommendations well. I appreciate a waiter that knows what he's talking about and doesn't just give off random suggestions or the \"well everything is pretty good\". The manager (gentleman walking around in a suit) was very kind as well. Always had a smile and was courteous.All in all, pretty good experience. Knocking down 2 stars because for the price of the meals, it could have honestly been a lot better.",
            "Credo makes me want to take back every 5 star I have ever given, because the bar has been raised!What an amazing dining experience. Came here after attending a Yelp event with Credo and was thoroughly impressed. I've walked by many a time and never came in. So glad I finally did.FOOD: The food was all amazing. We had the meatballs with polenta (yum yum yum), the octopus (most tender octopus we've ever had), the pizza crust pasta, squash blossom pizza, and New York steak. WHATA MEAL! Highlights were the meatballs, octopus, and steak. Soooo good. If you love octopus, get this get this. It was melt-in-your-mouth good. I love polenta and meatballs, and these were so flavorful and light. Apparently they take 3 days to make, and you can tell how much love goes into them. The steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare for me), and the fried green tomatoes on the side were so flavorful.SERVICE: We adored our waiter, Tim. He was honest and helpful, ensuring we had the best wine to go with our meal. and that everything was to our liking. Really great guy! General service was also great- our water glasses were never empty, and they didn't take our empty plates until we were BOTH done eating. Call me traditional, but this is important to me when dining at a nice restaurant.PRICE: I thought prices were very fair. For 3 courses each + wine, we paid $200. And we were beyond stuffed (2 courses would have been fine). Great serving sizes and endless bread!Overall, I think this place is an absolute gem. Not only is the food delicious and well thought-out, but the serving staff is an absolute delight. I want to spend every night dining here! Wonderful experience. Thanks Credo!",
            "~Food~  Burrata: It's peach season so the Burrata came with peaches and it was soo delicious. Burrata was soft, creamy, and spreadable. Peaches were lightly tangy and balanced out the honey. Perfect balance between the cheese and fruit.Meatballs & Polenta: Meatballs came out piping hot so watch your tongue. It was juicy and went well with a scoop of polenta.Mt. Lassen Trout: It's a little smaller than I thought but it was very filling. Juicy, not too salty, and the lemon emulsion wasn't as in your face as a traditional fresh lemon squeeze. ~Price/Quality/Quantity~  We came during HH, which cut down the price of the appetizers (burrata & meatballs) by a little. Total was $57+tax/tip and even though it was only 3 dishes, it was filling (prob from all the delicious carbs). I prob wouldn't say the $34 trout is worth it but I love this place for their appetizers. Come for HH.~Atmosphere/Service~Staff greeted us immediately and overall attentive. It can get a little loud in there during HH but overall still an intimate atmosphere. ~Bottom Line~Must get the Burrata.",
            "Came for lunch with my beautimous babe friend, but really should have brought a sumo wrestler and a lumberjack - portions are gargantuan!We had so much food (for ladies that lunch, that is!) Started with octopus, roasted root vegetables, and prawns - we really should have stopped there. Even this was too much. These were so delicious. I liked the way they worked this. No diggity. So I bagged it up. We had both agreed to order the \"Tarte Flambee\" pizza as our main to honor both of us (me being the tarté one, of course) before realizing how big the starters were. This was topped with pancetta and creme fraiche- found this to be much lighter than actual white cheese. My friend also had the pappardelle, and I looked away once and by the time I was back she had devoured it. I think she liked it. Great wait staff - and they even offered us a complimentary  dessert. Unfortunately, it wasn't a chocolate wheelchair to wheel me out so I had to decline. I would return - apparently there's huge private event space downstairs. Would be fun to throw a party or 10 here."

            "Beautiful ambiance, amazing food and hospitality. Make reservations well in advance if you need a specific time and date. We were very lucky to be able to make reservations late at night (a week in advance) after arriving from the airport, and they were very gracious in accommodating us. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, and I would recommend wearing business casual or something more formal than jeans. As a vegetarian I had a lot of options to choose from and particularly enjoyed the saghanaki, zucchini cakes, gigantes, and galaktoboureko for dessert. It was all very delicious and can't wait to come back again to try more dishes and order a bottle of wine next time!",
            "The food here can be pretty amazing, but some of it was a sore disappointment! If you order right, it can be overall a great dinner. RESERVATIONS: Made a week or two in advance on Open Table. THE SERVICE: Very professional and friendly. We had our 7-month-old and several staff were very charming with her!THE COST: $424.85 before tips, for a big dinner for 5. Pricey! Worth a nice occasion.THE FOOD: MEZETHES* Kolokithokefhethes (crispy zucchini cakes, $12.25) - 4 starsLove the crispy breading surrounding the soft zucchini! Great in the cold mint yogurt dressing.* Saghanaki (pan fried cheese, $16.50) - 3 starsFreshly fried, & you get a nice thick layer of crunch. Just not very interesting for me personally - a hunk of fried cheese sitting in its own oil without many accompanying flavors.* Hirino (pork belly, $15.25) - 3 starsI remember the meat being quite tough and just not very tasty.KIRIOS PIATO* Kotopoulo Souvlas (rotisserie chicken, $29.25) - 2 starsI didn't try this but my friend really didn't seem to enjoy it - she couldn't finish the dish and didn't ask for the leftovers!* Arnisia Paidakia (lamb chops, $47.50) - 4.5 starsAmazing! Juicy, with brilliant flavors. But also.. so pricey! Otherwise would be 5 stars.* Arnisia Souvlaki (lamb skewer, $38.25) - 3 starsMy partner wasn't too impressed with this. The meat was tender, but it had a lot of fat & cartilage to pick around.* Goat Stew ($45) - 3.5 starsA special of the night, the orzo was a perfect accompaniment to the rich chunks of goat. FYI there is cartilage - the meat is not 100% lean - but I am used to that in Chinese cooking! This had a slightly sweet flavor. The price point is pretty high, otherwise I'd rate this 4.5 stars.GLYKA* Galaktoboureko (custard in filo, $10.75) - 3 starsThe filo dough was a little soggy. FYI the custard had a slight savory/sour taste - can't quite describe it, but it's not purely sweet if that's what you're looking for. I liked the unique flavor though wasn't expecting it.* Loukoumades (greek doughnuts, $10) - 4 starsSoft filling, lightly crisped on the outside, great for sharing!* Kataifi (off menu, crispy filo pastry, $12) - 4 starsCrispy on the bottom, rich creamy custard (though not too heavy) on the top. Flavored with honey, pistachio. All amounts to a great dessert!",
            "Brought my parents and some family members here for a lunch and it was awesome. We were celebrating two birthdays and they accommodated us so well for about 10 people. Serving sizes are on the smaller side but the food altogether was very delicious. Service was impeccable and food came out very timely. Remember this is the city so be mindful about arriving early to find parking. We came during the lunch hour and though the restaurant wasn't too busy the surrounding area was.",
            "I've been to Kokkari twice now, but not for lack of trying to get here more often. Once I came for a fancy work dinner but on an odd work budget so it was like, yeah I guess I'll get a soup, a glass of wine, and an appetizer. It was the type of thing that normally throws me into a depression (not eating enough food for my midwestern stomach) except the food was so phenomenal and so different from any Greek food I've ever had before that it was more eye-opening than anything else. Last year for my birthday this guy I was seeing said we could go here. I opted to spend my actual birthday alone (they didn't have any reservations open anyway- I checked) and then there was never really interest it seemed to put the effort in to pick a date, make a reservation, and take me. So that died idea died in infancy and instead I took myself here like 6 months later after work when I was in the area. Like most humans, I'm on a budget and trying to continue paying my rent on time every month so I went in knowing I'd stick to the more modest side of the menu and get soda water for my beverage. I got super lucky and scored a seat at the very busy bar. The bartenders were super nice even though I was dressed like an employee of a Buffalo Exchange. I was sitting between some very quiet well dressed business men on one side and maybe the most beautiful bunch of lone women I've seen in all my life and I believe that to be pretty typical of the customer here. Beautiful & well off. I'd love to come here on some fancy date and really order it up but for the current moment, that's not where I'm at BUT the good news is that you can totally put together a nice little meal with their appetizers and sides. I chose their dolmas (best I've ever had), their shrimp... which were served sizzling in a cast iron pan in their full bodied form so you can eat the eyeballs and everything, and the octopus, which again was maybe the best I've ever had. As much as my own lower class insecurities were screaming in my head, the staff here and even the patrons around me were so nice. It kind of felt like we were a group of acquaintances meeting up... which is never how I feel next to people with money. I'd love to come back. Maybe sit at an actual table and get actual real dinner with a reservation like fancy people do.",
            "We had reservations here on a Monday at 5:30 and we ran 30 mins late, but they were still able to accommodate us. Their service is excellent and the ambiance is a cute spot for a date night with their dim lighting . I wished they had uni but sadly that is their specials on certain days. Lamb chops (4/5) the flavor was excellent and cooked to our perfection. Eggplant and asparagus (4/5) Griller veggies with Greek yogurt ! YUM! We also ordered calamari which comes with goat cheese inside . It was different and probably wouldn't order it again. As well as their fried cheese. It was literally friend cheese topped with lemon juice ?  A bit overpriced I would say . All of these were good but not WOW.",
            "Got a reservation at 10pm on Saturday, when we came, there were a lot of empty tables. I guess we can try to come earlier or walk-in in the future.The server recommended a Goat with rice dish as an entree, which is not in the menu but he said it is the most popular dish so far. In my opinion, this dish is the most disappointing dish. I expected goat dish to be savory but this dish is overly sweet that after having this dish, we clearly did not want to have dessert. This dish is as sweet as the dessert!!!For the appetizer we had Octapodaki tou Yiorgou which is grilled octopus with lemon, oregano and olive oil and Arnisia Plevrakia which is grilled lamb riblets with lemon & oregano.Both appetizers taste great, however, I have had this kind of dish somewhere else, so they are not that unique to me.The restaurant is very spacious, the interior decor including lighting, color scheme, artwork, table settings are very modern and exquisite. Overall, the ambiance is quite romantic. Service is also great.The bathroom is downstairs and you need to take an elevator to access it, which makes zero sense.I guess this is one of the best Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco, it is a place to go when I am craving lamb and goat meat.. but again, having an overly sweet goat main dish tasted really weird for me :(",
            "I've written time and time again about the amazingness of Kokkari Estiatorio in SF! The impeccable service, the warm, classic dining room, the choreography, and yes, the delicious food! Having eaten here five times already, I think I've nailed down just how to approach Kokkari for the best experience.First, skip the main course. Just order a whole bunch of mezedthes (appetizers) and make a meal out of them! I've always been so much more impressed by the execution and creativity of these small dishes, whereas the main courses seem more typical to me. The grilled pita with dips isn't to be passed up (the taramosalata and tzatziki are favorites of mine), and it comes on a nice platter with pickled vegetables and sliced cucumber! On my last visit, my favorite dish was the wood-oven roasted shrimp with feta butter--the plump shrimp, the salty topping, the crispy legs, and of course, the juicy, delicious heads!!Second, go for the specials. They always stand out as the most memorable dishes to me. There were three appetizer specials on my last visit, and we got all of them! The meat dolmades were served warm, filled with ground and shredded lamb and pine nuts with a dollop of Greek yogurt on the side. The loukaniko was a homemade Merguez sausage (on a skewer!) with a bitter cabbage/fennel slaw on top and a spicy harissa yogurt underneath. The sausage was lean and spiced absolutely perfectly! But the most unforgettable dish was the arnisia glossa: grilled lamb tongue on top of a tartar-like sauce (with chopped pickles). The grilled tongue was so tender and plump and not the least bit gamey or funky--it was just meat perfection!The food, service, and quality here are all top-notch. And the most surprising part? For fine dining in the heart of SF, Kokkari is surprisingly cheap! You'll never be disappointed by a visit to this amazing restaurant!",
            "This place is magnificent, we came here for our anniversary and loved our experience. All the servers were very professional and helpful, giving us great tips and recommendations from the menu. Saghanaki: this appetizer is probably the most delicious slab of gooey cheese you will ever eat. They drizzle it with a ton of lemon juice when they serve it to you, and it has a great tangy flavor to it. It's really crispy on the outside and has a hint of balsamic. So good.Octapodaki tou yiorgou: octopus appetizer, probably the most fresh and tender octopus I've ever had. It falls apart in your mouth with each bite and the pieces are a decent size. It drizzles with s great balsamic lemony seasoning that's to die for! I used to bread to dip into the oil ir came with and it was, life changing.Kotopoulo souvlas: several large pieces of a delicious roasted chicken, similar to the rotisserie chicken. There is a tangy flavor that I just couldn't pin point but it really gave the chicken the kick it needed. The chicken was so tender and juicy, and paired with the thick potato wedges, amazing. There was a light sauce at the bottom of each chicken that tasted like mint chutney and really added flavor to the dish.Moussaka: incredible. A popular dish on the menu as well, I believe. The lamb was so soft, not chewy at all. It sat on what looked like a stew of rice and juicy flavors, a great pairing and honey flavor. This tasted very much like comfort food, and the portions were quite large.  Dessert: baklava with hazelnut ice cream, what a great way to top off the meal! There were two large slices of baklava, stuffed with nuts. You can taste the rose water but only a hint, it's not very overpowering at all and still allows you to savor the other flavors. There were several large hazel nuts spread over top and the hazelnut caramel ice cream was so creamy and savory!",
            "I have dined at both this restaurant and at their sister restaurant in Palo Alto, Evvia. The menus are super similar, maybe even identical, but I think I like Kokkari a little more. The restaurant isn't as loud and crowded as the Palo Alto location. It is bigger, however, and I also felt the food was a little better.It's hard to go wrong with your order, but in terms of awesome dishes, I have to recommend these: saghanaki, rezes halianthou, and halloumi. Seriously though, order whatever--it will be amazing!The place is tough to get into, so reservations are a must. If you happen to find an open slot, take it! The wine selection is also impressive, so be sure to get yourself a bottle.",
            "Lots of great food here-- the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think there is room for improvement. We started with the saganaki, halloumi, grilled octopus, lamb appetizer and watermelon with feta.-The watermelon with feta was refreshingly good -The lamb and the saganaki were pretty delicious -I usually love halloumi but it was underwhelming here -The octopus was soaked in olive oil after it was cooked, which takes away from the char flavor I love about grilled octopus-Not sure what to think of the oily peppers; definitely not what I expected when I ordered it, and not sure it's something you want to eat just as is...We split the ribeye and lamb chops. Both were excellent choice. Nice thick cuts cooked perfectly medium rare.Finished the meal with an awesome kokkari sundae",
            "I was able to get a 6pm reservation as the only option at Kokkari Estiatorio about a month out which was a fine time for me.  It was booked solid as it is super popular.  I saw the $$ on Yelp so I underestimated how nice it was.  I felt way underdressed wearing a flannel and jeans as I had been doing the tourist thing the whole day and it was chilly.  So..  I felt out of place, but the hotel was too far to change.  The service was very responsive, helpful, and friendly.  The wife and I ordered fried cheese to start which was very tasty.  She ordered the lamb skewers and I ordered the lamb shank.  We were both happy with our entrees.  They made a good dirty martini as well.  My wife ordered the baklava for dessert and thought it was the best she has had.",
            "The best restaurant in SF in my opinion, considering value and consistency, spoken as a native of the city! Always quite busy even until the late evening, the blend of the warm comfort atmosphere and delicious food is incredible at this upscale Greek restaurant.Overall: 5/5Value: 4.5/5Decor: 5/5 Service: 5/5Food: 5/5We are regulars and love several of their dishes in particular, including the grilled calamari, lamb riblets, Greek salad, kataifi and more. Grilled Calamari is a standout. Fresh large cuttlefish stuffed with delicate ricotta and seasoned with herbs and a light citrus dressing then grilled. Incredibly savory and delectable. The Greek salad has the perfect mix of acidity from the dressing to the creamy feta cheese then the chopped tomatoes and cucumbers. I'm not a fan of romaine lettuce and all in Greek salads so I love how they use the whole tomatoes and cucumbers - this is literally my favorite salad. Lamb riblets are melt in your mouth and well seasoned. They're delectable and a great hearty appetizer to start off the meal with.Kokkari offers several fresh whole fish which are great and cooked well. I'm not the biggest fan of fish but I'm willing to eat it in this preparation! Very tender and savory sauce offset with meaty and starchy potatoes. Finally do not miss the kataifi if they have the dessert as a special! A thick layer of Creme fraiche on top of a philo nest crust, it's delicious and light yet creamy and fulfilling. One of my favorite desserts.Highly recommend Kokkari and especially to make a reservation in advance!",
            "Came here last night (Monday) with my husband for our early Valentine's Day dinner. I actually made the reservation weeks ago because we know how busy this place gets. We got there a little bit late but we got seated right away. We sat close to the kitchen so I could see every meal that comes out. Ah! I've been here a few times and 2x with my husband now - we love coming here. It's such a treat. Our waiter \"Tig\" was just as nice and attentive as he could be! He made our night just as fun. My husband wasn't feeling too well but Tig made sure that my husband was still having a good time. We ordered a lot of things. Well, we love food and my husband is Greek so we knew what we want. We had: Kolokithokeftethes - crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing. 4 stars. That dressing was fire. OMG. I can eat that sauce all day with anything! Garides Skordates - wood-oven roasted prawns with feta butter & Kalamata olives. 4.5 stars. The melted cheese over the prawns - Genius and Yum. I had 3 out of the 4 prawns. Ah! Soooooo good. Then I dipped some bread over the sauce in the pan where the prawns were served - OMG I was in heaven. We also had the Greek Salad. 4 stars. It was simply delicious. For our entrees, I had the whole fish. 4 stars. It was huge! It was decent. I took my leftovers to work the next day and ate it with my salad - it was tasty. Not overtly fishy on the smell. Then of course my husband has the Kokinisto me Manestra - aromatic braised lamb shank with orzo & myzithra. He loved it so much (he's a lamb guy) - he felt a lot better after eating them. LOL. And to end.. of course we had to get the Kokkari Sundae.. 4.5 stars. It was chocolatey, nutty.. delicious. Overall, our experience was absolutely wonderful. Everyone was working hard, attentive to every customer that walks in and dines. This restaurant is well run, you can tell. Everyone is moving.. everyone pays attention to what the diners need. And the food.. AMAZING! We even saw the Utah Jazz players dining there because they were playing against the Dubs the next day. We absolutely love this place so much. We will come back!",
            "We tried our luck for dinner on a Saturday night without reservations and were lucky to get squeezed in for a table. The restaurant is very big consisting of multiple rooms that are decorated to make it feel like a more intimate setting. The server was very knowledgeable about all he wine and food. She recommended a great bottle of red. We ordered the spinach pie, meatballs, grilled octopus, zucchini cake, and branzino. Everything was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. We ended with 2 desserts (I can't remember what ones but the one in my picture was recommended by our server and was the best). The prices are fair for the food as it was amazing, and the wine was not priced too bad. I would definitely love to come back!",
            "To enjoy the divine flavors,soul warming foods of Greek and Mediterranean cuisine this restaurant nestled in San- Francisco's-chic which usually entertains fashionable crowds comes with a side of old-world taverna hospitality,Kokkari Estiatorio will certainly live up to your taste.Our Anniversary dinner date was a memorable fusion of wonderful aromatic food in a classic ambience. We had reserved a table for two on the open table a month earlier itself. This is recommended to avoid long waits.The waitstaff is welcoming and professional. Despite the day being a weekday the restaurant was occupied tight. The sitting area is a massive space that doubles as a fancy dining room-cum-a hunting lodge architectural feel with plush sofa chairs, high ceilings, chandeliers and oriental rugs. This makes your dining experience cozy and to last for long.Places especially near the bar or the huge fireplaces are very inviting. To mention,the constant lamb aroma of the roasting meat fills the air though for vegetarians like myself I ignore that and simply enjoy the overall ambience that spells class.Since the restaurant is not very brightly lit,a sense of privacy to dine with friends and family is good. The Continuous flow of diners and servers keeps the aroma of the food flowing and energy up for all.The bathroom is downstairs and you need to take an elevator to access it.Kokkari's sophisticated menu leans heavily on the wood grill and rotisserie. Fresh,seasonal ingredients are well combined to create Mediterranean delights.Our friendly and well versed server helped us order our vegetarian food. Gigantes in appetizer, Makaronia- main course and Kokkari sundae for dessert. Simply delicious!With Virgin mojito and Mont-Redon, Reserve Cotes-du-Rhône to company the dinner was absolutely complete.#Gigantes- relishing!The dish was of Oven-baked giant beans with tomato sauce, olive oil & herbed feta. Very aromatic and lightly spiced this dish was served in an iron casserole. Color combinations well balanced.#Makaronia- Ravioli of summer squash & manouri cheese with mushrooms & toasted pine nuts. A simple yet a wholesome dish. The fragrance of butter (similar fat) was very strong, personally I didn't much enjoy it. A level up of seasonings would've been better. The ravioli felt fresh and was cooked well. The stuffed squash gave it the mild sweetness which tasted good.#Kokkari Sundae- an absolute delight!Chocolate & vanilla ice cream with hot fudge, whipped cream & toasted hazelnuts.The chocolate scoop gets licked off instantly! Not overpoweringly sweet the chocolate actually had a hint of very light bitterness which combined gracefully with the sweet Vanilla bite. The toasted hazelnuts were crunchy and accompanied the ice creams well. Overall this was an amazing end to my meal.#Drinks-Virgin Mojito- very refreshing. Felt good to sip with the food.#Mont-Redon, Reserve Cotes-du-Rhône a classic!An aromatic,charming white of medium body this 'by the glass' wine was good to enjoy the evening n food.Overall, it was An enchanting \"deep pocket\" dining experience where you'll want to lick your plate instead of breaking it...",
            "Incredibly delicious Greek food! This is a fancy restaurant in FiDi that offers possibly the best Greek cuisine in the city. Most of my friends happen to be very picky about Greek restaurants, so this one was a very pleasant find. We got a reservation for the Black Friday night ahead of time. The restaurant was quite full although there were still seats available. The dress code is pretty classy so avoid showing up in an athletic attire. What we got:A sampler platter of dips. It came with pita, cucumbers and 3 different dips. The portion was pretty big for the two of us, and I really liked it!Halloumi. It came garnished with pomegranate seeds. The portion was much smaller than the dips but equally delicious.Rotisserie duck. It was their special of the night, and we picked it over lamb chops. The portion was pretty big (bigger than you'd often get at restaurants of similar caliber).Moussaka. Ahhhh this is hands down my favorite Greek dish. I especially liked the soft top and the lamb. Greek yogurt with honey and dates for dessert. Again, really good and not overwhelming. Also, made me feel like I made a healthy choice.Greek Cabernet. This one was on the pricier side. I am not well-versed in Greek wines so had to ask the waiter for recommendations, but it turned out very well.One last note: I found their food quite filling, so you might want to skip the appetizers if you're on a date. It's just wayyyy too much!",
            "I found this place on yelp and was amazed at how many great reviews there were! We came early on a Monday night and the place was already packed, I'm so glad we made a reservation ahead of time! The grilled artichoke appetizer came with a Greek yogurt/ sriracha type sauce that was delicious and the lamb chops were so tender! I enjoyed both those dishes but the rest were mediocre and not too exciting. I wouldn't come back again but am glad I got to experience dining here.",
            "After years of wanting to try Kokkari, A and I finally made it and boy, was it worth the wait. We had a reservation for the day before Thanksgiving and the restaurant STILL was packed with locals and families visiting from out of town. I arrived to our reservation 15 minutes early and luckily the table was ready. As I wanted for A to arrive, I had time to really pay attention to the interior of the restaurant. It was so warm and cozy but still upscale which is really hard to pull off. I also loved how comfortable the chairs were (is that weird?) and the table settings.Once A arrived, we began to peruse the menu. While we were negotiating what to order, fresh bread and olive oil was brought to our table. The bread was OUT OF THIS WORLD and the olive oil was Kokkari's own brand which was really cool. We decided to go with an appetizer and separate entrees:-Kolokithokeftethes ($12.25) - We ordered the fried zucchini cakes based on the reviews on Yelp and holy moly were these delicious. I really wanted another order they were that good. I normally am not into fried food but the texture and contrast was amazing on these. You must order these.-Kokinisto me Manestra ($36) - A ordered the Lamb Shank and when it came, it was HUGE. Much bigger than other entree portions we saw go by. This was delicious and the orzo was a great accompaniment. A had to take leftovers (almost never happens) and these were just as good 2 days later.-Arnisio Souvlaki ($38.25) - This was mine and while A gave me some shit for ordering something \"boring\" it was out-of-this-world. Also huge so I had to take leftovers which were great re-heated. The potatoes and salad that came with the meat were great.I had my heart set on ordering dessert and the greek coffee but A had to hold me back (as usual) so we didn't get anything. Probably a good thing since we were both over-full by this point. The service was good and very attentive. One small hiccup is that we had to specifically ask to have our food boxed up even though it was clear we had a lot left. The waiter even started to clear my plate and piled the plate of olive oil onto my meat and some spilled. It wasn't a big deal but really, is taking food to go that uncommon?In any case, we cannot WAIT to come back. The food was fantastic, the service was great and I have to try dessert. Plus, maybe next time we will dip a toe into their wine list. Highly recommended if you're in San Francisco. This may just become one of our spots for visitors.",
            "Just had the most incredible meal with Jeff as our server. He was attentive and professional- we didn't want for anything. He made great suggestions. It kind of felt like Jeff was our Kokkari ambassador, kindly showing us the way through the various courses. The food was sublime. We had a smattering of appetizers- octopus, squid, lamb riblet and meatballs. All to die for. We didn't really have room but we somehow fit in a main course of the rotisserie duck which Jeff described so well. Topped it off with a delectable groups of desserts involving the special dessert- filo dough with something sweet and nutty- how could you lose?!?Kokkari is always great but Jeff's stewardship was definitely next level. :)",
            "I went here for a farewell lunch for one of my co-workers who was transferring to the East Coast. Our director picked out this place and I must say it is fancy! I did not have any prior expectations to coming here as I did not look up the place but oh-boy, I felt underdressed. We ordered Kalamari and Dolmathes with duck meat to share. I ordered a special, grilled seabass with lemon and sautéed spinach for my entrée. Kalamari - It is petite stuffed squid. The overall flavor was overwhelming for me. I did enjoy it initially but after one stuffed squid, I couldn't eat another one. If there was less feta, I think it would have been much better. The feta was over-powering, so you could barely taste the squid or the spices. Serving this on a salad would help cut the feta. Dolmathes with duck meat - This was delicious, a bit fatty but nonetheless, delicious. Bite-sized, so perfect to eat in one go. You could taste the mint in this dish and it helped cut the fattiness of the duck, the overall flavor profile worked. Grilled seabass with lemon and sautéed spinach - The fish was mostly de-boned: Big Thank You! It is a hassle to eat fish sometimes because I must pick through it worrying about the bones but not here! It made the experience much more enjoyable. A bit too salty for me but I am sensitive to salt, so don't let that deter you! Or ask for the fish to be lightly salted. I liked how they had the lemon wrapped up, it made for nice presentation and to be able to squeeze the lemon without the worry of seeds getting on your food. The spinach was good as well. Overall, delicious Mediterranean food, a lot I have not had before. This was a great dining experience. The service was excellent."

            "Was told this was the best breakfast in SF.  So we gave it a shot. I can say this was not only the best place in SF, but the best breakfast place i ever went to. First day in SF we ate at the place next to the hotel, it was just ok. Was told to try this place, which was only like a block away. we went every morning we were there.Pancakes were fluffy and huge, so tasty. French toast was amazing and the eggs were great as well. bacon & sausage were also top notch. id deff slso suggest ordering the fruit bowl. lol its more like a fruit bucket! its huge full of super fresh fruit, was just great. yes you may need to wait for a seat so either get there early or be patient cause its worth it. the inside isnt much to talk about so i wont, but its the food your going for, so if your in SF you need to get to this place for Breakfast, there is no other place worth going to.",
            "We returned to Hollywood Cafe over a quick trip to SF.  I don't know if the owners changed but the service, quality of food and service sure did.  The menu items were very overpriced compared to what you got.  I ordered the bacon and eggs with scrambled egg whites, smoked bacon and asked them for a side of tomatoes and to hold the toast and hash browns.  My husband ordered the CAB omelette and asked to substitute one pancake for the hash browns and toast.  We were told no on both requests because 'the toast is complimentary'.  I simply asked for sliced tomatoes which they have in their omelette so why couldn't I get that as a side?   And we were willing g to pay extra for a pancake.   Also, the toast is not complimentary because we paid $31 for breakfast which included toast as a menu item.  The service was just okay which was a bummer because we were looking forward to a repeat of our previous 5-star review.",
            "This is a solid breakfast spot in SF. Just like most of the other good breakfast/brunch spots, you can expect a line to form rather quickly if you're not the early bird getting the worm. The staff here is really good and the food came out pretty fast. The decor was cozy, definitely not a place you dress up to come to. If you're looking for a long breakfast to sit and hang out, this is probably not the best spot because they're busy and try to politely get you out so someone else can have a table, which is understandable.For food, I tried the avocado toast with fresh fruit. My plate was good, but lacking a little flavor. I didn't realize there was an accompanying spread on the plate until I was just about done eating, so that's my fault. The fruit was an excellent assortment and everything tasted freshly cut and ripe. My boyfriend had  the chilaquiles, which he found to be pretty good. Big portions and good service. Def worth visiting.",
            "This place was really good. My husband and I went her for breakfast before we went home. Luckily we went in at 7:30am after that there was a huge line to get in. I ordered pancakes and a side of hash browns and my husband ordered the eggs Benedict. Oh my gosh it does not only look spectacular but it tastes just how good it looks. The portions are huge so go in hungry!! Hope you enjoy this place as much as we did :)",
            "Somewhat pricey for breakfast items. But maybe that's just SFO in general? We ordered Eggs Benedict (Turkey & Avocado) and Vanilla French Toast. Very well presented with garnishes & fruit but I was hoping for a bit larger of a portion size. Overall, pretty tasty and worth the 30-minute wait. Certainly 100x better than the ridiculously overpriced Dennys just around the corner! Give this place a try!",
            "We waited in line for about 30 mins before being seated. French toast combo comes with two eggs and choice of meat and also a side of fruits. I went with the ham steak, which was decently thick and large variety of fruits like blackberries, strawberries, orange, banana, and grapefruit. French toast was pretty soft and tastes great with the butter and syrup. Hearty breakfast that was quite filling. Seems like a typical brunch place with lots of different options. Solid place but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for it.",
            "Ok The line out the door here is for a good reason food here is great. We had a 10:30 breakfast New Year's Day and I was impressed with the food.The guy who seated us was great you had two options sit outside or in,But he was nice and was communicating well.If you are in a hurry sit outside.Everything went well , food was great service inside was a little slow, asked for water never got it,Only refilled my coffee once and it was empty for a while.But I get it busy morning and food was well worth it ,I would recommend trying this place out",
            "Enjoyed breakfast here all week while staying in the Fisherman's Wharf area. It was definitely some of the best breakfast I've ever had. We had the bacon, cheddar, scrambled egg on toasted croissant, French toast with caramelized bananas, candied walnuts, caramel & whipped cream & the avocado toast with poached egg, arugula & chipotle cream. The staff were great & they get you in & out super quick. Wonderful dining experience! So tasty!!",
            "As you have read, you will have to wait! But in SF you have a lot of places you have to wait for so I didn't mind. I ordered their Hash burrito. I'm not a big ham fan so I subbed the ham for bacon and this was the best decision ever. Their bacon was the perfect crispiness and so flavorful. It's the nice thick cut kind of bacon. The eggs were cooked perfectly, nice and fluffy and scrambled really well. I didn't really notice the hash browns in the burrito that much. Either they weren't crispy enough to say, \"Hello, I'm here!\" Or there wasn't enough in the burrito for me to taste it. I also felt like the avocado didn't add anything to the burrito. It existed. But it didn't enhance any flavor. To make the burrito more flavorful I added a ton of the Cholula hot sauce that was on the table to the burrito and that gave the burrito the perfect kick it needed.I also had their regular coffee. The service was very attentive and never let my cup get less than halfway down. I have NO idea how much coffee I drank, I just know that with a to go cup of coffee in my hand, I left that place wired and feeling like I could conquer the world.",
            "Meh... having read the reviews I was excited about my brunch experience with this place. Walked 5 blocks in the pouring rain to get here. I ordered the deluxe French toast with vanilla. The French toast was blah, the mix of everything made the toast extremely soggy and the toppings didn't add any flavor to the dish. I requested a soft scramble for my eggs, they not only were not soft scrambled but they were also bland. I honestly don't feel that they were cooked with any seasoning at all. The fruit was really good however, very sweet to the taste. Sausage was your basic breakfast patty. My boyfriend ordered the crab omelet. The eggs were the exact same disappointment as mine, the crab was better but not a lot was included in the omelet. His bacon was just ok. Crispy but slightly burnt. Fresh squeezed orange juice was good but priced at $5 a pop.",
            "It's one if the best brunch cafe near here! I really loved the pancake and the syrup. Egg benedict was really good too",
            "This weekend we had a quick mini vacation to San Francisco,stayed by the wharf so we could walk everywhere once parked stated at Hotel Zoe check that yelp.Breakfast is my favorite so we looked up what our options where this place popped up right away.menu looked good and it was 520 steps away. The weather was amazing so off we went. So in San Francisco lots of tourists equals credit cards, apple pay etc. These guys CASH only..ok Atm across street. Lots of outside dog friendly seats and inside cozy,plenty of great staff members and greetings as you walk in we went early so no line as we left big line but worth every second food hot,fast,and delicious,coffee was never missed plenty of choices for everyone you will leave FULL. I had the 2 pancake combo hubby had veggie omelet huge. I look forward to our return.",
            "Ok my omelette was really one star only but my girls liked their food so I'm giving it 2 stars. I guess if I hadn't waited for 30 minutes my omelette would get a 2 star as well. Also their bathroom was \"out of order!\" So you wait a bunch of time for mediocre food and there is no bathroom to use! I used to live in the city and my standards for food here are high compared to the Suburb I live in now but I can tell you all my breakfast places at home are way better than this place. Which brings me to the question: how the hell is this place listed as to breakfast at the city?",
            "Came in early and the place is already filling up at 730am! Ordered their crab omelette, and based on the portion I got salad instead of the regular hash brown. Such a good choice! The portion was outstanding and I really enjoyed my omelette. The crab meat, though not super fresh, was fresh enough for me as to not having that annoying strong seafood taste which usually stemmed up when the seafood was set long. The avocado goes well with it, and the whole thing was lightly salted. The overall taste was very balanced and the ingredients great.My friend ordered eggs and bacon sandwich and he enjoyed it. The only complaints was that they gave too much fruits haha!The side toast was ok, goes well with the omelette.Service was good and fast. The staff was friendly. A very good experience overall.",
            "This place is one the best breakfast places I been too, I had the chilaquiles with chorizo it great combination. They where so good I went the next day to have them one more time on my stay in Bay Area.",
            "Good Benedicts, mediocre French Toast, bottomless coffee, and expensive for what you get.We came at around 9 on a Thursday, and were seated immediately. The seemingly Thai staff was friendly and we had three-four people waiting on us.The menu had a little something for everyone, but the prices were mostly between 10-15.  When the food arrived, it looked appetizing (except for my wife's lacy fried egg). The Benedicts were delicious and the hollandaise wasn't too salty. My wife's French toast was quite sweet and soggy, and the egg was so tough it was nearly inedible, making us believe the prices for the food weren't warranted.Be warned, using the restroom will send you deep into the bowels of the warehouse to the restaurant is attached. The winding hallways lead you to a restroom straight out of a slasher flick where you'd expect to find either a glory hole or a psycho killer waiting for his/her next victim.",
            "Having stayed at the Holiday Inn - Fisherman's Wharf, we were needing a breakfast place. A restaurant at our hotel was very poorly rated, so we ventured out and found this cafe. What a treat! We ended up eating there for four straight days. I had French toast, pancakes, eggs and bacon, and an omelette. It was all delicious. My favorite was the French toast, very flavorful. I found the pancakes to be dense (and mine were slightly overcooked) but still good. The bacon is the best, thick and real. We were very happy to eat here! Word of warning: it's small and fills up quickly. We arrived at 7 AM (when it opens) and by 7:30, there already was a line. It moved quickly and it would be worth the wait.",
            "Gave this a try due to the Yelp 4.5 star rating and we were staying at the Hyatt Centric across the street and saw the line from our room.  Portions are large and the dishes were good and satisfying, but there's nothing special about this place.  If you're in the area and looking for brunch, Surinan around the corner has a much more interesting and flavorful menu.I ordered the Dungeness crab Benedict and upgraded the hash browns to the Hollywood Cafe hash browns.  The Benedict was fine though a bit milder than I prefer, and the crab a bit fishy.  Be careful eating it since we found a couple small pieces of shell in our crab.  3.5/5The Hollywood hash browns were not crispy, and were topped with sautéed onions, peppers and bacon which made them more flavorful.  However I was a bit surprised that the upgrade cost was $3 when ordering a la carte was only $1.50 between the normal hash browns and the Hollywood style.  3.5/5My husband ordered the egg sandwich which came with two English muffins with fluffy scrambled eggs and bacon inside.  Simple but solid, 4/5We also ordered a fruit cup which had standard but good fruit like blueberries, blackberries, bananas, oranges, strawberries and grapes.  However at $10.99 I was expecting a larger bowl.  4/5Fresh squeezed orange juice was good.  We arrived at 11am on a beautiful San Francisco Saturday and waited for about 25 minutes for a table of 2, which isn't that bad if you're used to the crazy brunch places in the more hipster areas.",
            "This place was very close to our hotel and we didn't want to do the boring hotel buffet. When you walk in it is all decorated with various Hollywood paraphernalia. Pretty cool old time photos of some of the most famous actors. Its a neat little place but not crazy fancy or anything. The menu is what you would expect from an approachable breakfast place. Their thing is that they have several dishes named after the actors themselves. I got the Marilynn Monroe. It was french toast with fresh fruit. The french toast was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The fruit was surprisingly fresh, all in all very well done. The coffee left you wanting more but you can't have it all I guess. Good experience but definitely not the best breakfast in town.",
            "Iv been craving some non traditional eggs benedict and this place delivered. I came for an early sunday breakfast after working a night shift double. Its by alot of hotels in a tourist part of town so it was packed but I was able to get a table and staff were hustling so service was still quick.I ordered the dungeness crab and spinach eggs benedict and upgraded the hash browns to their house special hollywood hashbrowns with bacon, onion, mushrooms, bell peppers, and cheddar cheese on top. The benedict was dank and the crab and hollandaise made for a rich and succulent combo. They include a bit of fruit and a big rack of hash browns. The hashbrowns were really tasty and filling but while the toppings were a flavor upgrade idk that its worth 3 more bucks for a sprinkle of stuff on top on an already 20 buck breakfast. If you dont really care about value and just want the best as I did that morning go for it tho.All in all a really delicious meal that satisfied my craving and staff that were really hard working and efficient considering how packed the place was. In diner fashion they have a cool atmosphere and alot of old school photos of hollywood celebs etc if your into that too."

            "Back at Wayfare again! This time we were seated upstairs which was quite lovely and intimate. The food is delicious as always. We ordered the housemade mint lemonade - so refreshing. The mac and cheese and the charred little gems paired really well with the fried chicken. Service is impeccable as always!",
            "Hmmm.  Wayfare is a Great Atmosphere and High Energy Tavern! The hostess was an amazing friendly young lady.  She worked hard to find us a table and we were seated as promised in 15 minutes. Little entry bar is small, minimal seats, and only had one very busy bartender.  Hard to get a drink when you are competing against the entire tavern. But still worth the stop if you are waiting on a table. We had a cool table upstairs and received menus quickly. Support team was great - bread/water/etc. but our server (Enrique) was too busy (apparently) and had trouble with a few items throughout the night. After waiting 15 mins for a table drink, I received the wrong bourbon. They offered to dump it and get me what i ordered but was nice and said it was ok. *then i discovered it was something rare and $27 on the rocks. WOW. Apparently Wayfare Tavern is known for their Fried Chicken. Top Ten Fried Chicken in the US (it advertises and its in the menu). Two members ordered it and unanimous decision was \"Not that great\" - both left it on the table. We also tried Salmon and the Pork Chop.  Both were good, but nothing memorable. Another service item was the waiter forgot our sides - never noticed, never apologize, just went back (after we were almost done) and dropped them off.  I also saw another party that had to grab the manager to get a wine list - as no one showed up to wait on them.Atmosphere was great, hostess is best in town, but the service is poor and food average.  Almost got the vibe that the staff didn't care, given the place was packed. No apology or offer to take off the wrong drink / sides. May try it again in a year or so, but not a favorite or recommendation right now. Thanks Hostess - family appreciated you.",
            "Service was friendly but disorganized. Timings on dishes coming out and servers coming by was a little off.Popover was a little dry, went great with butter, but the butter was over salted.Burrata was ok, not what I expected but suitable.The famous fried chicken was really disappointing. I wouldn't call it fried chicken - it was more of a half baked half fried chicken. Drumstick and wings were tender but the breast was dry. It lacked soul.",
            "FINALLY!I've been wanting to come here for years, and finally the stars aligned and I was able to go while in town for work.  My friend and I snagged a reservation at 815pm on a Tuesday night.  When the restaurant called to confirm, I asked if they had something sooner, and they had one at 745pm so I moved our reservation up.  By the time we got to the restaurant, it was closer to 7pm and it had started raining.  I figured there is only two of us, let's see if we can get seated earlier.  Our luck, they were able to accommodate us in the back of the restaurant at a table for two.  It didn't look like they were seating folks upstairs, but strictly downstairs.  It made it very cozy.Once we were seated, our server came over and within a few minutes we got popovers before we even ordered.  They were nice and warm and served with butter.  YUM. Now, I KNEW what I was getting.  My friend didn't know about this restaurant so he had to do some research before arriving and ended up getting the same thing as me.  FRIED CHICKEN.  You have to order sides as extras which is a bummer, but you get a leg, thigh and the breast split in half without bones.  Honestly, one of the best fried chicken I've had.  The meat was so tender.  The dark meat was fall off the bone and the breast meat was juicy.  Clearly they know what they are doing.  The popovers kept coming which was great.  We also ordered mac and cheese and broccolini.  I was pretty sure I read broccoli but apparently it wasn't, so I was a bit disappointed.  Should have gotten the brussel sprouts.  Desserts were just so good.  My friend got essentially a brownie sundae.  I got this cake dessert thingy that I can't remember the name and it's not on their menu online for desserts for this season so sorry! But it was chocolate cake, plus a mousse plus ice cream plus a piece of honeycomb candy.  It was so decadent.  Coffee on the side was also amazing.  I will be back - that ribeye looks amazing.",
            "Food. We all split the Fried Chicken, Akaroa Salmon, and 2 dishes of the Bouillabaisse. The Chicken was great, very moist, and the perfect amount of breading. Lots of flavor but you pay for it. The Salmon was cooked great, very flaky but I was hoping for some more flavor (presentation was great and it might of got my hopes up). The B-word was maybe the better dish due to the Lobster Broth. I waited until no one was looking and slurped it up like it was the remaining milk from a Cinnamon Toast crunch bowl of cereal. I'll bring a straw next time.Service: Great service but expected from a fine dining restaurant like this.Sidenote: Bring that straw",
            "Wow. Absolutely fantastic. I arrived on a full stomach, not expecting to eat at all. I heard the fried chicken was legendary, so I had to order that. We also started with some burrata and deviled eggs. The bread was absolutely fantastic, it was hard not to fill up on this. The burrata was also excellent, it ended up being better eating this on the complimentary bread than the toast that it came with. The deviled eggs were the biggest disappointment of the meal, they didn't seem... fresh. I prefer deviled eggs that look like they've been freshly whipped and somehow these looked like they'd been sitting in the fridge for awhile.The fried chicken made everything better. It came with 4 pieces, that looked like they were fried in two different ways, the top two pieces seeming darker and more crispy than the bottom two. It was *almost* everything I had dreamed it would be, at least one of the four pieces was extremely dry, but at this point I was extremely full so I was just eating for fun at this point. Like almost every other review, I am going to insist on the fried chicken if you've never been here before.",
            "Forest mushroom risotto and tavern burger Came here on a Saturday. Easy parking since everything around it is closed. Had a reservation but seemed like I didn't need to make one for a late lunch. Food is amazing! Well worth the expensive price tag. Portions are average. Quick and attentive staff. It felt sort of cramped where we sat next to the fireplace though. Booths look roomy.",
            "I heard about this restaurant from my best friend who is quite particular about her restaurants, so I knew if she liked it, it would be yummy. Came here on Valentine's Day with the boyf. They use OpenTable which is nice and convenient. We came about 15 minutes early and were seated right away. Service was great and super attentive. We did our research but we got the following:Starters:-Popovers: (no charge) but served in lieu of bread and absolutely amazing. The whipped butter is everything! My boyf + I had two each - would've had more if we didn't just order so much food.-Steak tartare: way too much for just two people but super yummy. House made chips were a highlight.-Oysters: we got have dozen east coast and west coast (3 of each). Tasty and fresh, but not memorable.Entrees: -Fried Chicken: Their award winning fried chicken and what my best friend told me to get. Perfectly cooked, crispy and the portion is huge. So amazing - an absolute must.-Scallops: (Valentine's Day Special) served with albino asparagus and mystery brick of potato-like vegetables. This is what my boyfriend ordered. He thought everything on his plate was too salty but said everything was cooked perfectly. Sides:-Mac + Cheese: smoked oil flavor was unique but overall the mac + cheese left more to be desired.Dessert: we ordered daily assortment of ice cream (you only get one choice *cries*). We ordered house made mint chocolate chip - good but not worth $8 (it's just one scoop)Wine/drinks:They have a well-thought out cocktail menu, but I just stuck to wine. My boyfriend ordered a hot toddy ($14). He wasn't the biggest fan, but I think he was just shook that it was hot (it was his first one ever - *eye roll*).They also have an extensive assortment of wine - by the glass or full bottles, but we had a nice bottle that we wanted to bring. Corkage fee: $25.100% would go back again. Definitely recommend. Get the popovers and fried chicken.",
            "Been eyeing this place for a while, especially since I'm a huge fan of Tyler Florence ever since watching him on Food Network. Also, glad I got try this infamous fried chicken that's so well known!The restaurant is super cool inside with British gastropub kinda feels. We came with a reservation (which I highly recommend) and were seated immediately. Parking wasn't too bad on a weekday too which is a plus. We started off with their awesome bread service, which were fresh popovers! That probably elevated all bread experiences, alone. We also got the beef tartare and the deviled eggs, with both being super flavorful and delicious. The tartare was huge, but so good! For our entrees, we decided to share two plates of fried chicken and a brussel spouts side between three people (which was plenty). I could literally smell the fried chicken coming towards us as the server brought it to the table. It was very aromatic, and the batter was light yet crispy. Onto dessert, we got the chocolate charlotte. It was a great chocolate dessert, but kinda sweet for me. All in all, a great place for comfort food!",
            "I highly recommend this spot for business lunches (and lunches/meals in general). I've been here twice and really enjoyed my meals here! The interior is also so pretty and cozy. FOODTwo dishes are the BEST: the beef tartare and the complimentary pop-overs (omfg so good). I just... I'd go back just for these two. I personally wasn't a big fan of the deviled eggs (idk why, just tasted kinda weird to me even tho I love deviled eggs). The fried chicken is good but I'm also not the biiiggest fan of fancy fried chicken (I love my Korean and Filipino fastfood chicken). VIBELove the vibe here. Think classy/country club? A great spot for both lunch and dinner/drinks. SERVICEExcellent! Super attentive and helpful. MONEY THODefinitely on the pricey side - but portions (especially the fried chicken) are pretty big, which is great.",
            "Love this place. One of my favorite spots in the City.  The popovers are life changing. I got the burger protein style and it was massive and delicious. I asked for the green goddess dressing on the side salad and it was fantastic! Sitting along the counter in front of the kitchen makes for an entertaining dining experience. Can't wait to visit again.",
            "Welp, another successful holiday luncheon in the books at Wayfare Tavern. It's been tradition over the past 5 years to eat at this establishment, and it never disappoints. We always start out with the seafood tower, some deviled eggs and the complimentary pop overs. Btw, the pop overs might be my favorite part of the meal, they are so delicious! I've had the fried chicken and the burger countless times before, so I always look to the specials as they have been spot on. This time around, the king salmon on a bed of kale and other earthy vegetables. It was fantastic! I'd recommend bringing your own wines to pair as they offer corkage and the wines are treated really well with the servers. Thanks again Wayfare and Merry Christmas!",
            "We made a reservation here and once we ordered, our food took a long long time!  The table next to us got sat down a good 15-20 minutes after us and they got their food first and we ordered the same salmon special.  Not sure what happened there but we were a bit flustered at how long it took to get our food.  We came in after the lunch rush.  We heard great reviews about this place so unfortunately we were disappointed.  Food was good but I'm not sure I'd visit this place again!",
            "Okay, I think it's only fair that I start with my continued crush on Tyler Florence - ever since Food 911. So, once again on one of my trips to SF I have to go to my happy place - Wayfare Tavern. I had an incredible Sancerre and the salmon. It was truly all done to perfection - and as I studied the ingredients while I savored each bit, I would not have thought about carrots, two different types of mushrooms, and what appeared to perhaps be tiny cubes of sweet potato. Skin on, cooked to crisp perfection. What an absolutely amazing way to kick off an extremely busy weekend.",
            "Good grief the fried chicken was delicious combine that with the ambiance = a great lunch date It's everything you want from fried chicken: crispy chicken, moist meat, generous portionOverall ThoughtsI definitely want to come back to check out the dinner options",
            "1. Service: Amazing. 5/52. Ambiance: Dim and romantic! 5/53. Food:- Complimentary bread & butter (this was so good!) - Bone Marrow: Good but a little salty. 4/5 ($18)- Organic Fried Chicken: It wasn't as amazing as I expected, but I would still rate this 4/5 ($27)- Macaroni and Cheese: This was also really good! 5/5 ($11)- Wayfare Burger: This was actually my favorite!!! Better than expected 5/5 ($23)- Porto Frites: Pretty good 5/5 ($12)- Brownie Sundae: I loved this!!! Very chocolatey, but the little crunch balls were so good with this combo. ($11)Overall, I'd highly recommend this spot. Cute for a birthday dinner/date night. Didn't have a problem with parking at night either.",
            "Probably one of the best fried chicken dishes I've ever eaten. They claim this is an award winning dish and I will have to agree.  The location is perfect but of course parking is a challenge as it's San Francisco. The menu items included the burger the beef tartare and the broccoli which was all absolutely amazing Expect to pay a little more for a meal but trust me you will get what you pay for and the service is outstanding. Never was my water glass less than half full and the food came out hot and quick.  Great experience!!!",
            "Came here on a Wednesday during restaurant week.  Here is my take on the place:Pros: The staff starting from the hostess, being seated to our waiter- everyone was great!  They were hustling and bustling because of the amount of people that made reservations.  Place was a mad house by 6pm on a Wednesday!  Big kudos to the hostess that was extremely courteous, generous and respectful working hard, sorry didn't catch her name. Tip: Stack up on the staff if you know it's going to a be a busy day. Cons: Our food came out late, salad and bone marrow were served together, when the request was made to have the salad come out first.  Our server did come and check up on us here and there, but he was super busy.  The food was ok.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  The fried chicken was good, but not great. Nothing fancy about it, but having lemon and garlic served on the side. Was not impressed.  Our dessert was literally a frosted donut. Felt weird using a fork and knife to eat it.  This place is in the FiDi so you should already anticipate the kind of crowd you're going to see.  For $40 per person it's not bad to experience for yourself, but if there's a chance you could try another restaurant during restaurant week I would skip this.",
            "TL;DR - Great fried chicken, amazing burger, looking forward to a return visit. Worth the money and lives up to the hype!Wayfare Tavern is pricey, but it is worth it. I used to work around the corner, and have been here twice. Once I tried the famed Fried Chicken, easily would eat again. Another time, had the Tavern Burger, easily would have again.Pro Tip: Call ahead for a seat, this place is small and gets busy.Location/Parking: Wayfare Tavern is a small place hidden in the financial district. There is ample parking at any of the garages in the area. I have walked from Union Square after shopping, it is quite a walk, but it is doable.Wait Time: Depends, most I've waited was 20 minutes on a Friday night.Staff: Hit or miss for the host, some of them are nice and friendly, while others know they are the gatekeepers of a top notch San Francisco restaurant. The wait staff is great! The bartenders are cool/friendly.Environment/Ambiance: It is a dimly lit two or three-story house looking place. (I've only been to the second story, so the last story might be decorative, or I might be delusional, but I thought I saw a staircase going up from the second floor.) The first floor has one kitchen, a lounge area with a fireplace, a few bar top tables, a 6-seat bar and maybe a 2 person seating area by the door as a waiting area. The second floor has a lot more room and does not feel as cramped.Food Review: I remember two plates that I've had here, and would definitely recommend them.Organic Fried Chicken: It has won best fried chicken in Food and Wine magazine for a reason. It is that good. It's a perfect balance of flavor, not too salty, not too breaded. The roasted garlic and herbs compliment the perfectly cooked chicken.The Tavern Burger: Every part of this burger can be enjoyed separately. The bun, the cheese, the bacon, the burger, the toppings. It's that good. But you wouldn't do that, that's insane. Put the burger together and be taken to the land of excellent burgers. You should try the burger with everything on it, even if you don't like 'this' or 'that.' This burger does not come with lettuce or tomatoes, the toppings are on the side and they are cucumber and freshly chopped red onion. It's amazing. You won't want lettuce or tomatoes any more, and you'll scoff at all other burger places that present burgers without the new cucumber & red onion technology that you just discovered.You can thank me later.",

Off the bat I would definitely come back to get some more. Dim Sum is well steamed and fresh!The lady in front was awesome! Multitasking by running the servers, taking orders, and restocking the Dim Sum. Very straight forward and knows the menu by heart.I would recommend to anyone who want to grab a quick bite or to go orders. My wife and I enjoyed it! Coming back next time we go by the area!",
            "You can get your tasty dim-sum morsels without the sit down experience of a dim sum restaurant by going to take out places.  There are many places in Chinatown you can go, but there are some that are better than others. If you know that place on Stockton St, you know that there's always a waiting line that stretches out the door. Dim Sum Bistro is the latest take-out dim sum business to occupy this location. The prior establishments' offerings were nothing that wowed you. I've been coming here for the sticky chicken rice that's wrapped in bamboo leaves.  Very similar to the Chinese tamale or joong.  Eating one makes a good meal with the tasty chicken filling encased by the sweet sticky rice. Each time I visit, the line is always getting longer. So that it is a good sign the overall dim sum offerings here are very good.  I will have to try some of the other dim sum items next time.  Service is pretty good. The ladies speak and understand English as I see them servicing non-Chinese speaking customers without difficulty.   With reasonable prices and tasty dim sum, I'll be back more often.",
            "Came in on a Sunday as part of my \"dim sum sunday\" tradition. It was raining outside, so we wanted a place that was bakery-style but still had a few tables to sit down and enjoy our dumplings. We arrived around 1ish and there was a line. I waited for about 10-15 minutes in line as everyone zipped around pointing at dumplings, speaking in languages I didn't understand, scanning some sort of coupon/discount barcode I couldn't read, and paying in cash (they take credit card but cash was  much faster). It was great and definitely felt authentic. I filled out a little order sheet of paper to avoid any language barriers-- 3 of that, 1 of that.. and watched as the shocked ladies behind the counter began to stack our dumplings. Ok, I might have over-ordered. For under $40, 3 of us feasted on the largest buns and the largest siu mai I've seen (that come in beef too!). They even gave us free egg rolls...before telling us \"now no more ordering for a while\" :P Everything was delicious and huge, and we all had leftovers for the next day. Will definitely come back!",
            "Cheap, full of locals, and good dim sum. If you don't have time to walk up to Good Mong Kok, I'd recommend dropping by here and getting your dim sum if you want it to go. Just remember your cash.Get a pair and know how to order here over the other Chinese people who may order over you. My meek butt always gets pushed around haha. I always just take to go and I'm never disappointed.",
            "This place was great. The seating area is small so you might have to share a table with someone but everyone does so it's fine. It is very inexpensive. We ordered steamed pork bun, spring roll, pork potstickers, shrimp  dumpling and steamed custard bun. Warning- the potstickers and steamed buns are huge! There may be a line but it goes fast. I highly recommend.",
            "I come here all the time, check out the Youtube Video I made on this place: youtu.be/5BJWro3EjVMI had a lower rating before, but they've really stepped up their game! ~~Parking: They have street parking available, but I assume you'd probably already be parking in some lot somewhere. They are part of the Park & Ride Program for Chinatown! ~~Service: Nothing to complain about. The only interactions you have with the staff is in the beginning when you're ordering your food. ~~Best Part: Food quality & taste. ~~Worst Part: Nothing.~~Tips: Definitely get the har gao and steamed pork bun!~~Return: YES, YES, YES!",
            "Get in and out with your to-go dim sum fix with the quickness at this joint. Generally most of the dim sum shops in Chinatown offer the same menu with similar prices. Dim Sum Bistro is a solid choice since they're really quick and there's no time wasted when it comes to their service. There's an authentic vibe that welcomes both tourists and locals.",
            "this review is for their Baked BBQ Pork Buns.for $1.40 each, that's about the market price for the Baked BBQ Pork Buns in SF Chinatown.fair price.the buns itself were good in size, the bread to filling ratio was decent and were sweet and chewy.I don't think they have the best BBQ Pork Buns in SF Chinatown, but they are good and one of the solid option if you're in the mood for some.",
            "Got some dim sum to go.  1 order of shrimp har gow (3 pieces), 1 order of shrimp/pork sui mai (3 pieces), 2 Taishan bao, and 4 Joong.The shrimp hargow was delicious  and so was the shrimp/pork sui mai so I ate one of each on the way home. I had one of the Taishan bao which contained pork, egg, and mushroom. It was was huge and delish. The joong are super huge with glutinous rice, peanuts, pork, and year old egg wrapped in bamboo leaves.Prices are reasonable and the dim sum is very tasty.  Will go back the next time I'm in San Francisco.",
            "I will definitely be coming back here. The 20 minute walk in the rain from Powell was worth it to come here because the food was good! We got here around 2-3pm and some of the items we wanted were not there, but the items we did get were delicious! My friend and I both got har gow and shumai but she got the pork noodle and I got the shrimp one. Although the pork noodle and shrimp noodle didn't come with the sauce that usually comes with it at other dim sum places I've been to, I believe the food was still very tasty. To be honest, my friend and I were expecting that we would have to buy more food but (surprisingly) we didn't have to! We ended up finishing everything above and it was filling enough to get us through more walking in the city during the rain. I want to come back to try the items I wasn't able to try this time around. The staff was friendly and the door to the kitchen was open so we were able to watch them making more shu mai. Im sure parking in the area is difficult so I suggest commuting or walking here from Bart (about a 20 minute walk). Also- SO CHEAP! Both my friend and I spent less than $10 and they take card! I'll be back to try more stuff here!",
            "SERVICE:Friendlier than the typical Asian restaurant service. Food is prepared quickly.FOOD:Everything I've tried here so far has been pleasant! I have gotten the following:1) Dumplings: har gow (shrimp dumpling), Chiuchow fun guo (Chaozhou-style dumpling), gau choi gow (shrimp & chive dumpling), pork siu mai, and shrimp siu mai. Succulent and generously sized.2) Rice Rolls: pork rice roll, shrimp rice roll, and dry shrimp & chive rice roll. Each roll has multiple layers of rice sheets and tastes great when paired with the sweet soy sauce!3) Pork & Preserved Egg Congee: Smooth, comforting, and flavorful. The pork and preserved egg are cut into bits.4) Baked Char Siu Bao (Pork Buns): These are HUGE. They tend to be a little short on char siu filling than I'd like, but they're still pretty satisfying. 5) Sesame Balls w/ Red Bean Paste (Jin Deui): They have a good crispy and chewy exterior, and a generous amount of red bean paste. These are delightful.6) Black Bean Ribs: Served w/ rice and bok choy. If you're looking for a tasty, no-frills meal for under 5 bucks, then get this. RECOMMEND? YES.Deliciousness at affordable prices. Love coming here for takeout!",
            "We wanted some yummy bao's.  There were a ton of little bakery and dim sum shops lined up along the streets of China Town that we could of chose to eat from, but this placed seemed to be BUMPIN (just a lot of people lined outside the counter) lol.  TIP: *Cash only*!Its somewhere to get a quick bite to eat.  Very casual... there are some spots to eat inside.Inside the actual business isn't the cleanliness which is why i'm not inclined to give them 5 stars, but they work fast, and make really yummy and tasty food.  They mostly speak Chinese, so there could be a language barrier for people who can't speak Chinese. They do offer paper menus in english since their wall menu is only in Chinese.",
            "A badass little spot. I happen to just be walking around the area and my hungry sense started tingling (a la spider sense/foodie sense). I noticed a good amount of people eating inside but with a smaller than expected line. After  waiting for my turn I move in and ask for some dim sum. Not too much as I wanted to test this spot out, I should have ordered a lot more. It was truly delicious! It's not a big fancy restaurant but if you want something quick and tasty this is your spot. The service was quick and friendly. I didn't want to hold up the line that formed behind me so I quickly ordered. I skipped my general question asking. Once I ordered, I was given the food right away and I gobbled it up. Delicious, quality food and quick! What else can you ask for. I definitely suggest you come here. It's a small spot but large in taste.",
            "This was strictly average dim sum- which for me is a great thing. For $11 I had a huge meal and a great value. Everything was delicious except for the baked pork bun which I wouldn't have ordered if I didn't read other reviewers excitement over it. It was disappointing- the sauce was too strong in an uninviting way.Otherwise, from the steamed shrimp dumplings to the pot stickers and corn cakes, all was yum. The sesame ball was tasty, and their mochi dessert was absolutely delicious and full of coconut joy!I went on a busy Sunday and stood in a peaceful line for 20+ minutes. I was the only white guy there- everyone else appeared to be Chinese. If I lived nearby, I'd learn their slow times and would eat here regularly.",
            "Dumpling and shumai we're amazing. Pork bun was also good. The Banana Leaf thing was not the best. Would come back again.",
            "I use to come here way before the new owners, and the food is still good if not better. I like how they cleaned up the wall menu, and added paper menus for the non-Chinese speaking customers.But I hate how popular it's gotten cuz now the line is longer! Me no like lines",
            "This place is good sheep and fresh of the company here for decades. We always stay nearby so we always come here in the morning",
            "This place has the best reasonably priced dim sums in Chinatown and possibly SF. The hidden gem is their steamed rice options (chicken, Chinese sausages, or pork ribs) which are simple but affordable and delicious. All the locals get their steamed rice!",
            "Small place (around 10 little tables) but the dim sum was good. We were 8 but we only paid around $65. They have many choices and the lady was nice with us. You should try the shu mai and the shrimps dumplings.",
            "Tried ordering the siew may and porridge for 7 dollars only!! I split it with my mom because it was too much for ne. The portion is generous, the food taste good, and the price is cheapp! Loved this place"

            "Solid 4 stars.  At first they asked us to go next for because they had a long wait and we're gag a okay of 6... to their sister restaurant Perbacco. We checked it out but didn't want to go there so they were actually accommodating because they made room to seat us at the bar,  although we had to sit separately. The server seemed a little annoyed we wanted separate checks (business trip) but nicely did it was not a problem. He helped out my colleague with her menu choice since she has a gluten allergy.  That was good. I ordered sparkling water - good,  from Italy. The so of the day - potato leek - DELICIOUS,  please try out if you like potato.  Keep in mind,  it is not chunky if that's what you're looking for.  Orecchiette  pasta  with fennel sausage and broccoli - very good! I would recommend asking foot some red outdoor flakes to complement the dish.  Overall,  if I'm  in the area, I would come back but definitely would like to try other places in SF!",
            "I really want to give this place a better review, especially since the service and the venue are both spectacular, but the food definitely brings the rating to a 3. The staff are SO nice! We came a bit early for our reservation, and the hosts were very friendly and happily took us to our seats early. The restaurant is super small, and we ended up sitting at the counter. I would highly recommend a reservation if possible. As for the food, it was somewhat of a miss for me. We ordered the ricotta bruschetta, and the bread was way too crunchy for me, and I couldn't really taste the flavor of the ricotta. I also got the tagliatelle bolognese and my friend got the cavetali. The tagliatelle noodles were well made, but there wasn't enough sauce and the sauce itself was very bland. The Cavetali had a really delicious lamb sausage added to it, but the noodles were a let down. They were very undercooked, and tasted like hard, rounds of dough. I have definitely had better pasta, unfortunately, but if you really want italian food and this place is nearby, I might come again. But definitely go for the tagliatelle and skip the cavetali.",
            "We came here on Valentine's Day for an early lunch with no reservations and they were able to seat us at the counter, which is where we preferred anyway. If you want table seating, make reservations, because they fill up quickly. The Barbacco staff are nice, attentive, efficient, and quick, which is everything you hope and wish for when you go out to lunch during work hours. You can tell that they have thought service through and it makes a difference. We started with the Butternut Squash Bruschetta, which had apples, arugula, and saba. The bread was crispy and the squash with the apples created creamy goodness. Taste buds were extremely happy. Moving on to our entrees, I had the Orrechiette pasta, which had sausage, broccoli, pecorino cheese, and my husband had the Fettucine alla Bolognese. You could really taste and appreciate the homemade sauces and pasta. Portion sizes were perfect and we left feeling full but not overstuffed. We'll be back for sure!",
            "Wow, fresh, high-quality pasta and at a reasonable price?! I'm in!This place was a little more romantic than I thought it'd be, but nonetheless, I held my hopes high for a good quality meal. We started with the meatballs and the brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts were great, but slightly overflowing the dish - we ended up making quite a mess out of trying to eat them (I wished they had came in a bowl instead). The meatballs were also fantastic, hearty and in a delicious tomato-based sauce. We were sat at the bar, and the counter space was very limited, so we had to sacrifice the remnants of these dishes to receive our entrees. I had opted for the orecchiette (after reading reviews) and my colleague chose the spaghetti bolognese. My dish was 5/5 excellent, the pasta was cooked perfectly al-dente and refreshingly different from traditional sauce (tomato or cream) based pastas. My colleague's dish wasn't nearly as impressive, the flavor was a little more predictable, duller and the pasta was slightly overcooked. All in all, I'd come back to get the orecchiette again.",
            "This is an excellent restaurant for date nights, friend get togethers, and business lunches or dinners.The service is on point and the food is toothsome -- both the gluten-free options and the gluten-full selections : )Tables are set up toward the back right for parties of two, directly across from the bar, which runs along the left side.There are larger tables for bigger parties at the front of the restaurant and a few small tables in the window.I have been here numerous times and each time it did not disappoint.They are open late enough that they can accommodate diners who work late or attend after work events.Recommendations:+ Mariposa Gluten-Free Toasted Bread or Toasted Acme Bread (plus amazing dipping sauces)+ Burrata with Arugula -- the real deal+ Octopus with Potatoes and Celery -- umami and crunch all on a small plate+ Brussel Sprouts -- a must have!+ Fish Special -- Cojo Salmon with Salsa on a bed of Fennel and Arugula+ Gluten-Free Corn Rigatoni with Corn, Cherry Tomatoes, and Ricotta -it's REALLY GOOD!+ Vanilla Ice Cream with Crumbled Honeycomb, Raspberry Sorbet, and Chocolate Ice Cream with Creme Fresh -- so yummy!",
            "Solidly 3 stars.Good Italian restaurant in the heart of the Embarcadero district, just a few blocks from Bart. Up sides: very convenient location, attentive service, good food. Downsides: very loud, not intimate, no space between tables for a real conversation, meal is rushed. Our waiters brought our main meals (pasta, chicken, fish) while we were just starting our appetizers, which sucked because we couldn't enjoy the cold plates - we started on the hot ones, lest they got cold. They then circled around trying to clear our plates more than 10 times as we were eating!! (Fork to mouth... \"Ma'am are you done? \"... Fork in mouth... \"Ma'am are you done here?\") I don't fault the service people; I'm sure they're told to do this by the owners so as to turn over tables more quickly. Make no mistake, the food is quite good - try the burrata with pesto sauce, the orecchiette with sausage, and any of the desserts. But I wouldn't plan to come for a long or romantic evening. Oh! And no cocktails. Beer or wine only.",
            "So good. So glad I finally got to try this place for dinner. They don't have a lot of alcohol options because of license, but what they do have isn't bad. I tried the negroni cocktail (gin, red vermouth, Campari) and the wine mojito. The negroni was strong as it should be, and it was pretty too. The wine mojito tasted very refreshing, but also watered down. The food here is great though. We tried the burrata, meatballs, and the meat fettuccine. The burrata tasted amazing, and it went well with the veggies and fruits with it. I wished there was more burrata there though, since the amount was small and surprised me. The meatballs was excellent. It came with 3 of them, and none of it was dry. Super moist, great texture, delicious. One of the best meatballs from a restaurant that I've had! The fettuccine with the meat was good too. The texture of the pasta was perfect, with some chewiness with each bite. Al dente perfection. YUM! It got a bit salty on the bottom though, as most of the sausage bits and whatnot ended up near the end of the dish. We tried the carrot cake for dessert. It went very well with the ice cream on top. The carrot cake itself was super dense, so the ice cream on top was a definitely must. Would come back again and again!",
            "I had a reservation for lunch at 11:30 and this place was packed quite fast and a line for lunch. So glad to make a reservation without wasting time waiting. I ordered their Brussels sprouts and bruchetta for appetizers and both were pretty good. Their flatiron steak from the lunch menu was good too that came with a white sauce thingy at the bottom, mushroom, arugula, crispy chips on the side. My party said they liked their pasta too. Service was attentive. Overall dining experience was good. One thing to note is that their tables are very close to each other, which makes it a bit inconvenient to get in and out. I'd come back the next time to try their other foods.",
            "What I got:Seared OctopusOrecchiettePolpetteBurrataWhat I thought:The ambiance of this place is great. Nice lighting and decor. They have a TV at the bar as well if you're trying to get a peak at the game during dinner.Food was pretty good. I thought the octopus was OK. wouldn't order it again. They have an extensive appetizer menu so I'd probably go for something else next time.The burrata we got was amazing. It came with this honey walnut bread and that was hella bomb. The bread was crisp and sweet. Went extremely well with the cheese and wine we had. Def a good starter.The pastas were good. Although, I much preferred the fazzoletti over the orecchiette. The sauce was rich and flavorful. The sauce on the orecchiette didn't taste like much to me.The polpette was very tasty. Meatballs were moist and sauce was great on it. I would order this again as well.Pretty solid Italian food overall. Waiter was very nice also. I'd make a run back here next time I'm craving some pasta.",
            "Widely considered the cheaper version of its next-door neighbor, Perbacco. Although the vibe inside the restaurant is nice, the food doesn't quite deliver. For the main course, I ordered the Fusilli dish with pomegranates. It was rich and creamy, but it was extremely bland. I ordered it because I was curious how pomegranates would go with pasta, but it was not great. It was too tangy for the subtle taste of the pasta. The fusili was also pretty undercooked. I thought maybe it was just my pasta but I had similar feelings about the mushroom pasta as well althought it was a bit better. The Brussel sprouts that we got for the appetizer, however, were fantastic. They were extremely crispy and full of flavor - could've honestly made an entire meal out of those brussel sprouts.",
            "Solid 3.5 so I'll round up. We ordered a bunch of apps-- crab cake special, burrito, seared octopus, butternut squash soup, and brussel sprouts. The octopus really stood out for me, and the brussel sprouts were pretty good although nothing special about them.The entrees we ordered included the halibut special, orecchiette, steak, and the pork shoulder. Of those I had the halibut and tried the orecchiette, and felt that both lacked... something. The fish was prepared perfectly flaky but lacked much flavor, and similarly for the pasta. Kind of disappointing.The ambiance was nice, and service was good considering we had a large group. Overall I enjoyed my experience and the meal but was not bowled over by the food.",
            "For a FiDi lunch spot, Barbacco is 5*. The prices are reasonable, the location is convenient, and the food is tasty. What more could you ask for?As the casual younger sister of Perbacco, Barbacco is one of my go-to spots when having lunch with coworkers on our own dime. Reservations are a must and you can usually get one during prime lunch hour if you plan a few days in advance.The pastas are what Barbacco is known for and are generally in the $17 range. The sandwiches are a steal. On my last visit, I ordered a Roasted Porchetta Sandwich that came with provolone, arugula, and delicious onion jam. It was huge and it ended up being lunch for 2 days. The meat was tender, juicy, and a little fatty (in a good way). The spiciness of the arugula paired with the sweetness of the onion jam was heavenly. At $14 for the sandwich, that's basically the same price you'd pay at a take-out place.",
            "Great meal. Came for Saturday dinner and it was really full and lively. Ordered the Bruschetta, Orecchiette, Polpette & One more dish that I can't recall the name of. Personally did not care for the Bruschetta. -B",
            "Big disappointment. The food is overpriced and underwhelming. It seems Barbacco is trying so hard to be fancy that they fail to be Italian. The portion sizes are so small they are unsatisfying and the menu deviates from classic Italian in pursuit of some nondescript flavor blending. I ordered the spaghetti and the sauce was nonexistent, consisting solely of chunks of tomatoes. The spaghetti, dubbed \"Octopus Spaghetti \" was an unusual thick spaghetti noodle colored black. I'm not impressed and will probably not return.",
            "Odd shaped tables. Parallelograms, really. But let's focus The Brussels sprouts are the odds on favoritte, judging from all the Yelp photos. Delicious but so salty they should be served with a blood pressure cuff. Orecchiette is a close second. Small nuggets of sausage in it are probably the most interesting but too few to matter. It has green matter in it that make it appear healthy and visually more appealing. It is the most overrated past dish and at $17, perhaps the most overpriced. I think people just like to say orecchiette. It means small ears but everything sound better In Italian. Porchetta was a special. Unlike most others, this one had a thick slice of loin encased in a thick rubbery covering of fat. Oh, I should have said pork belly, like our waiter did, because that sounds better. I think there was hope the fat would make the loin a bit juicier.",
            "We had a decent dinner experience at Barbacco. 8pm on a Thursday evening, the place was quite busy - definitely best to make a reservation for dinner. They said it would be a 45 minute wait, but we got lucky with a small corner table, just big enough for three. It was cozy, but doable for a last minute dinner, although there was a cold draft throughout most of our meal. The restaurant seating is a little crowded, with the tables a little too close together and wobbly contemporary chairs that aren't very comfortable to sit on. We could very easily hear the conversations of the two tables next to us.We ordered a Burrata appetizer, Vegetarian Meatballs, Corn Fusilli, the Fettuccine, and the Chocolate Nemesis Cake for dessert. The Burrata was great, definitely an appetizer you can't go wrong with.Of the entire meal, my favorite was the Corn Fusilli - the pesto seemed to lack salt, but the texture of the dish was what really got me. The sweet corn kernels added a great \"crunch\" to contrast with the al dente pasta. I added a little bit of salt and I have a tendency to put chili flakes on everything, so those added a little extra flavor for me too, but even without those, the dish really stood out.The Fettuccine was alright - while the pasta was well-made, I wanted the dish to be a little creamier. Instead, it came across a little watery and didn't really come together for me.The Vegetarian \"Meatballs\" are made with Impossible brand meat, and it's great to see a prominent upscale restaurant offering these options. The texture of the meatballs is soft and every bite bursts with flavor. As a vegetarian who isn't used to meaty textures, this dish is a little bit of an adjustment, and it's definitely geared towards meat-eaters trying to incorporate vegetarian meals into their diet. Nonetheless, it's a well-made dish that deserves 4 stars for both effort and execution.Finally, we ended our evening with the Chocolate Nemesis Cake. The slice was very dense, more like a solidified mousse than a cake. It was good we shared the slice between three people as a couple of bites was more than enough for all of us. I didn't care too much for the candied hazelnuts - the smokey flavor was too overpowering. The presentation also left much to be desired. The other dishes came out neatly plated, but it seemed the the cream and hazelnuts on the cake were just thrown onto the plate.Our waiter was very friendly and service was solid. We really appreciated them making space for us on a busy night. The food is so-so, but I can see how the atmosphere makes for a nice evening out.",
            "Came here last month to try some Italian food cause I was craving some pastaaa! This is a nice cozy upscale restaurant (ambience definitely works for date nights). Thankfully since this was a close walk from the hotel we were able to quickly walk over and be seated promptly. Once seated we ordered the following:Arancini - this was yummy, basically warm risottos with cheese inside. The red tomato sauce that it came with really helped add to the flavor and I can safely say this was delicious!Fazzoletti - my friend ordered this and I was able to try it as well. Unfortunately here the sauce did not taste really good per my taste buds and I felt the pasta lacked a tasty flavorSquid ink pasta - I got this one and I did not like either. The sauce itself was a little too salty for me and I was disappointed with the lack of taste.Carrot cake - we ordered this for dessert and loved this. The carrot cake was warm and moist and it came with a yummy ice cream. Although the meal itself wasn't good it was a great way to end the dessert with a hot and cold dish that complimented eachotjer really well! Good way to end the night!",
            "I have yet to find a delicious pasta place in the Bay and this place has not stopped my search. We had dinner here on a Saturday night with reservations. We were seated promptly and service was great the whole night. Decent fare:-Arancini: I've had better but this wasn't bad. Really thick balls of risotto deep fried with cheese in the middle, so what's not to love. - Meatballs: Juicy pork meatballs with pine nuts and raisins in tomato sauce. I would get this dish if you come here. What took this down to 3 stars:-Orecchiette: The pasta itself was decent; cooked well with a great texture. What threw me off was the hard chunks of broccoli scattered throughout. I've had broccoli orechiette before that was executed well and I can't say the same for this. -Bruschetta: Wow, the saddest bruschetta I've ever had. The bread was tiny and ridiculously hard. There was some sad flavorless balsamic sauce on top and then sprinkled with some pink pickled thing and shaved Parmesan. They really need to change this dish up. Overall, not impressed with this spot and the search for good Italian food continues.",
            "They seemed quite able to accommodate our relatively large group (8 people) which is always notable since that can be a tricky thing. We started with the little gem salad (great) and the brussels sprouts (much too salty) and cauliflower (fine). My orecchiette was definitely the highlight though. Bright and rich. Pretty large portions too. I'd got again and probably just get the same pasta.",
            "Loved this place for my Anniversary dinner date! We walked in on a weekday, and waited for about 30 minutes for a table (you can make a reservation to avoid this wait time!). The hostess was very helpful, and kept us updated. We got a cozy corner and enjoyed our food. There wasn't much vegetarian on the menu, and if you are vegan it may be more challenging to find anything except salads! But the waiter gave us some excellent recommendations! Burrata cheese was so amazing, bruschetta was good, and our vegetarian version Orecchiette tasted great too! Service was on point. Though it was a little noisy, the ambience was intimate and romantic! We are extremely happy and definitely coming back again."

            "I've had this place on my mind for a while and actually had brunch reservations planned for later this month when my friend chose this place for lunch- I'm so glad he did! We came in at 2:20 on a Thursday and they close on weekdays at 2:30 to prep for dinner so we were forced to order quickly. The service was super attentive and we ordered quite a bit. The portions here are not lacking for sure. Tried:1. Kobe Beef noodles - 3.5/52. Pork Tacos - 5/5 I don't like pork but this was incredible. 3. Poke - 5/5 fresh ahi tuna, so good. Even the crackers were special and really brought out the flavor of the poke.4. Cucumbers - 4/5 basic cucumbers but had nice vinegary flavor with a good amount of sesame seeds Definitely not the place if you prefer super authentic Chinese but either way it's a great modern twist (nothing too spicy btw) I don't think you could go wrong here! Can't wait to come back for brunch",
            "AVOID THIS PLACE!!!I have a food allergy to spicy ingredients. My wife and I called ahead and were told they could accommodate. Upon ordering I was assured the chicken teriyaki was safe. They delivered my wife's food and informed me that I couldn't have the dish and there wasn't anything on the menu that I could eat. So I sat there and watched my wife eat dinner and they charged us full price. AVOID THIS PLACE!",
            "Meh... Short story: decent food but overpriced, unique drinks, tiny tables, incredibly slow service, 90s-2000's hip hop, get there when it opens or make reservations.Incredibly small tables really take away from the atmosphere which is pretty cool in and of itself. The place is small and fills up quickly. They did not let a party of 2 sit in a 4 person booth during my visit.The food is decent but definitely not worth the price they charge. To be fair here, the skyrocketing SF rents have put a lot of good places out of business. Given the size of this place they probably have to charge that much to keep the lights on. I also was irritated at how slow they were. I grew 3 beards, lost my hair, teeth, and eyesight before my food arrived. Staff is very friendly but very slow. It's worth checking out but I wont be back for a second trip.",
            "Chubby Noodle is one of our go-to dinner places in North beach. On a recent dinner date, we got the papaya salad and the garlic noodles with fried chicken and wiped them both off. the place is tiny so you could be sitting really close to the next group but the food is legit and ofcourse you can walk around by cute italian restaurants and grab a Tiramisu after which is wonderful.",
            "I came here for brunch and had a good experience over all.It was a little weird for me to not be able to order what we like but I love trying new things and being able to try the entire menu on a roll-out basis was really cool. I also liked that the waiters let us order seconds of anything we liked. It was a win-win over all.All the food was fresh, seasoned to perfection, and a good portion without going overboard. It was easy for our group of three to finish everything and we were able to order seconds and thirds of our favorites, leaving us very full and extremely satisfied.The mimosas and sangria were delicious and they never let our glasses go empty.We were a fan if Chubby Noodle and will definitely be back!",
            "This place is a great hangout spot with amazing food and ambiance. They have creative drinks, but make sure they're available (they ran out of 2 of the drinks that I wanted). I've tried the following dishes:Spicy Garlic Noodles: Loved the charred roasted garlic and chilies in this dish. There were many levels of flavor in this dish. Szechuan Green Beans: The flavor was absolutely outstanding. I wasn't expecting it to be so delicious. Definitely my favorite item on the menu. Roasted Cauliflower: Didn't realize how amazing vegetables tasted. So good.Chicken Fried Rice: This dish was not oily or salty at all. Very tasty. Salt & Pepper Shrimp: Great batter and sauce on the side. The combo of scallions, sweet onions, and garlic chips added another depth of flavor.",
            "We happened to come here on Valentines Day, which was random, but we stopped because for the first time, it wasn't overly busy with people waiting in front of the door. I had never gone before, but I used to roll my eyes at the fact that the menu would say things that showed they don't know Asian food (tonkatsu ramen, anyone?), but I always hear good things, so I was willing to sit down and try the food. I made jokes about some of the things on the menu like the fact that the Korean pork fried rice is made Chinese style, etc etc., but when the food came out, man, did I shut up.We ordered the fried chicken, the lil' Kimchi, and the curry vermicelli and everything was delicious. They were all so flavorful but in different ways so we did not get tired eating one and switching to another. The kimchi may be a basic appetizer, but was so good all on its own. The service was decent, but not exactly wonderful. The music was poppin' and this is clearly a place for young-ish crowds to hang out in so don't expect this to be a family place (to the reviewers out there that complain that it's not family friendly, this place in no way advertises itself to be). The environment is crafted for younger crowds and there's even a Buddha made into a lamp, which was super weird. I would completely come back to eat here again, though be aware that some restaurant goers are ratchet and shout in their drunken fits, but man, it is North Beach after all.",
            "On music alone, this place gets a TEN! What's more fun than eating with chopsticks while listening to all the songs that you'd scream at the top of your lungs while on a road trip (just watch that you don't poke an eye out!)? In fact, the table next to us was in from Arkansas for a bachelorette weekend, and they were pretty much the road trip minus the car; singing and dancing to every song, and it was hard to not get involved. Let's just say that we've basically been inducted into the bridal party.The food was a little bit of everything Asian fusion; we had pad thai, fried rice, and I had the sweet potato vermicelli noodles with chicken. Everything came family style, but each of us was so happy with our dish that we had a hard time sharing. My only regret was that the waitress misheard me when I wanted my food boxed up and it was disposed of. Would have made a great cold noodle breakfast the next day, but the waitress made it up to me with a wine on the house.",
            "This review is for the bottomless price. All you can eat + all you can drink?! We made reservations for a Saturday brunch. They seat parties in rounds and you must order the bottomless brunch! They take your card down when you make a reservation and charge $25 pp if you flake!! There are currently 3 drinks to choose from: watermelon mimosa, sangria, and Sapporo. There are 15 dishes including cold dishes, noodles, and tacos. My favorite dish was the salt & pepper shrimp - crispy with a bit of a kick! I also enjoyed the Korean vermicelli, Kung Pao wings, and veggie fried rice. The only thing we tried that I wouldn't get again are probably the tacos just because they were insanely filling so it wasn't worth it to eat. The drinks tasted just fine. The biggest downfall is the 90 minute limit on brunch. It felt really rushed!! You're only able to fit in 4-5 rounds of food in and drinks depend on how fast you can chug each drink. They will take away your drink you're currently working on if you ask for a different one! I think 2 hours would be a fair amount of time for the brunch. I love the music and fun vibe they have going on! Definitely a nice place to gather with your friends, be loud, pig out, and get drunk!!",
            "So many restaurants make their fried rice nothing more than steamed rice and frozen vegetables. Not Chubby Noodle. Their fried rice has so much flavor. You can see it. Big chunks of very tender bqued. Pork. Soooo delish. Was there 15min before closing to grab some to go. The other items on the menu are yummy. Recomend the fried chicken too.",
            "I wanted to check out this place since I heard great things about it. See below for storytime if y'all are interested, lmao. SERVICE:I made reservations for a party of 10 people a couple weeks back. I arrived on the day of and the server told me there is no reservations under the name, \"Emmy.\" That threw me off because I gave them my name, phone number, and credit card information (which they will charge my card if I'm a No-Show) over the phone. She kept on denying my reservation. Honestly, I thought I was tripping at this point. Like I somehow confused my reservation at the other Chubby Noodle location (Lombard street)? Girl, no. Lol. I then asked her to look at the list again. She mentioned all of the names listed, where \"Ashley\" made a reservation for 10 people. That's when I told her to check the phone number and if needed, I'll gladly give her my credit card as proof. She finally realized that someone mistaken my name when I was making a reservation. OK, that kind of put me in a bad mood initially since it took her 15 mins to figure it out.FOOD:We ordered the spicy garlic noodles with shrimps, shrimp rice, shrimp pad Thai, and the kung pao wings. The $13 spicy garlic noodles wasn't spicy at all. Very light on spice. I wanted to add shrimps for protein and it was $5. However, each shrimp dish  had 3 shrimp pieces. So you're basically paying $5 for 3 shrimps per dish, lol. Shrimps fried rice tasted better. My friends told me the wings were bomb. As for shrimps pad Thai, it was alright to them. MUSIC:They were playing RnB throwbacks, alternative RnB, modern POP songs, and a couple hiphop while I was there. Pretty chill music. This was the best part about my dinner.",
            "Chubby noodle is what I call an experience. It's extremely busy on weekends but if you wake up and get there right as they open, the bar is open! Make sure to make reservations well in advance if you're going on the weekend if you want a promised seat. There's 2 locations and they apparently used to serve different things but now the menu is standardized.It's all you can eat 15 dim sum dishes and options of all you can drink - 3 drinks for a 90 minutes.So I will say the 15 dim sum dishes are more of Asian fusion plates like Korean, Vietnamese, some Chinese rather than dim sum. Not a lot of traditional Chinese dim sum dishes which was a bit disappointing for me and more of the traditional/ dirty Chinese options. There's one bathroom and warning - it gets loud. So ambiance isn't conducive for an intimate conversation. Think awesome playlist, great fun atmosphere that's great for parties with friends.",
            "Came here for a big group birthday brunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. Go for the bottomless brunch! You get to try the entire menu and have bottomless drinks for 90 minutes. Make sure to make a reservation well in advance as their brunch program is fairly structured and seating is limited.Fave dishes: hangover stew and shrimp",
            "LOVEEE CHUBBY NOODLE. If you want a ratchet brunch spot which great music, this is the place to be. You can also request songs too! My last review was wayyy back but obviously it's better now and great service. I love taking friends here who are visiting and giving them that full brunch experience with unlimited food and drinks! Plenty of bars to hop around too.",
            "We had a yummy dinner at Chubby Noodle in North Beach. This is actually Chubby Noodle's second location. It opened in June 2015. The original, located in the Marina District, opened in May 2014. This is a popular Asian restaurant and bar serving modern, fusion-type fare along with sake, cocktails, beer, and wine.We walked in around 6pm on a Thursday and there wasn't a wait. However, when we left around 7pm, there was a wait. This place isn't terribly big, but it's not tiny either. I'd guesstimate they have seating for roughly 40-50 customers, bar and dining room combined. They're able to accommodate larger groups (5+), but only 1 or 2 at a time. The space consists of a combination of 4-person booths and tables with both bench and stool (no backs) seating. Booths are definitely the way to go here. You can call the restaurant to book reservations.The restaurant has a simple, clean, and contemporary design. The build-out and furniture still look and feel relatively new. The interior has an Asian flair with lots of light woods (some of which resemble bamboo), suspended paper lanterns, and bar decor such as a Laughing Buddha statue and an assortment of Japanese teapots. The storefront has two windows which were open during our visit. These gave the inside a bit of an open-air feel. The atmosphere was casual and relaxed and the music that played was early 2000s hip hop and R&B.The menu has more adult beverage options than it does food options. There are a little over 20 dishes to choose from, from cucumber salad and kimchi ($4 each) to tuna poke ($16) and pork ribs ($17). As for the \"noodle\" aspect of Chubby Noodles, they offer 5 different kinds of noodles: spicy garlic egg noodles, ramen, chow mein, curry lemongrass vermicelli, and pad Thai ($13-16 each, toppings extra).Here's what we tried:* Steamed pork buns - shredded pork, shiitake mushrooms, napa cabbage, Thai chili, hoisin (3 for $13)* Spicy garlic noodles - egg noodles, charred garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, and fried chicken ($13 for the noodles and $5 for the fried chicken)* Pork ribs - Coleman Ranch pork, jalapeno, vinegar soy glaze ($17)We enjoyed everything. The food was delicious. The ingredients were good quality and each dish looked great and was presented beautifully.The steamed pork buns were served in a dim-sum-style bamboo basket complete with lid. Each steamed pork bun came with a generous amount of shredded pork *and* chunks of rich and fatty pork belly (the latter wasn't mentioned on the menu, so it was a pleasant surprise). The pork was soft, tender, and well-seasoned with excellent flavor. The steamed buns were chewy and pillowy.The spicy garlic noodles were fantastic. The egg noodles were thick and delectable. They were coated in a savory, addictive sauce. The fried chicken that we added on was worth it. It was lightly breaded and boneless. It came with a creamy sambal sauce on the side which looked similar to and sort of tasted like Sriracha mayo or a spicy chili aioli. Yum.The pork ribs were terrific. There were 4-5 pieces on a plate stacked one on top of the other. The bones were big with each piece having a decent amount of meat. The meat wasn't exactly fall-off-the-bone, but it didn't have to be. It was still tender and succulent. The vinegar soy glaze was sticky and sweet. Good stuff. I recommend all of the items we had.My buddy got a 24-ounce can of Asahi Super Dry beer for $12. I took a sip. The drink was crisp, ice cold, tasty, and refreshing.Our server was Estefania. She was cool and friendly and did a wonderful job.A single unisex restroom is located in the back. You have to walk through/past the kitchen to get there.",
            "Well I'm just OBSESSED with this spot. I literally feel obligated to take anyone here who hasn't been yet. I've made 4 trips recently to bring my visiting friends, and everyone seems to LOVE it just as much as I do. I can't leave without the pork tacos and pork buns - they are just so melt-in-your-mouth amazing I feel like I dream about them at this point. The garlic noodles with fried chicken and the beef chow mein are also delicious so I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu really.",
            "Randomly decided to walk to North Beach from downtown to eat here on a Monday night. The ambiance is nice with Chinese lanterns hanging on the ceilings. For my main, I ordered the spicy garlic noods with added fried chicken (+$5). There was surprisingly a lot of chicken that came with the dish (chicken was under the noodz). The garlic noods here were decent, but not as good as Perilla. It was also not spicy at all. For $18, I didn't think this dish was worth the price. I probably wouldn't come back for dinner. I do want to try their bottomless mimosas tho. On another note, the music was pretty lit - lots of old school jams - think Keri Hilson - Knock You Down - and other litty hip hop songs. Service was on point as well so +1 for that!",
            "Lots of flavor. Their fried chicken is moist and fresh. Their cocktails refreshing and service great! I'll be back!",
            "Their spicy garlic noodles is what I come here for. I've tried their tonkotsu ramen and I've probably wouldn't order it again. My coworker loves it though so... try it. Try everything here because everything sounds delicious. The service staff is nice but the food does take awhile to get to you from the past few times I've been here.Overall, good experience and good food. Definitely recommended.",
            "Solid food! I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here just because I live very far from it, but the food was great for the price. I got the garlic noodles and the fried chicken. Both were delicious and fresh and the food came out quickly. They even had gluten free options for the garlic noodles dish and other things on the menu if your friends or family are gluten free. Very allergen friendly. This place seems like a great place to go to get food when you've been out drinking at bars! I would recommend trying this place at least once. The only negative was their bathroom. Not the cleanest I've seen and unfortunately had to walk through the kitchen to get to it."

The vibe can not be fabricated here and this is the spot to go if you're catching a few brews and bar food to pair.Service here is what brings people back. Super casual, friendly and homey vibe. The pours here are very generous and you won't break the bank coming here.",
            "Your typical hole in the wall pub food joint serving up a greasy array of burgers, sandwiches, fries appetizers and salads. The staff was friendly for our afternoon weekday lunch. A couple stray Giants fans were there for pregame festivities as well as businesspeople from the nearby warehouse district offices. Your best best here is a cold beer and a burger, however neither of those were on my wishlist (pescatarian and a lot of work sitting back at my desk). I ordered an iced tea to drink which was constantly refilled by the waitress. Our group started with mozzarella stick appetizers and potato skins. Both were a hit but nothing spectacular. For lunch I went with the grilled salmon salad. The portion size was very large but the salad was very blah. Lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, grilled salmon with the skin on, and balsamic vinaigrette. Flavor was lacking on the fish and I wish the salad would have had avocado, cheese, and or some summer fruit. It is served on a large plate but the salad was easy to finish as it was mainly just lettuce. Those who ordered bacon cheeseburgers at my table were much more satisfied and they could barely choke down half of their meal without loosening the belt buckles. Don't come here for the food, come here for the environment and to drink beer. A great sports bar. On the plus side, it's open for private events if you want to rent out the entire space.UPDATE: we have all our boozy work lunches here. It's surprisingly popular. This time I went with the beet salad and added salmon. It was much better than the grilled salmon salad! Also had a glass of rose which was way too sweet for me but you can't really expect much in terms of wine at this establishment.",
            "The place had a really bad smell and even worse a fly came out the ketchup bottle when I poured it on my plate because I wanted to dip my fries into it",
            "My feelings towards Grumpy's are hot and cold. I'm not satisfied every time I go, but its location is perfect for whenever need a quick hot meal. The grilled chicken is good, however sometimes the bun isn't always fresh. The fried chicken with mac & cheese looks better than it tastes. Quite unfortunate because it has so much potential to be great. The food is hit or miss, yet I keep giving them my money. Lol. The price we pay for convenience.",
            "I really enjoy my meal at grumpy's, it was my first time visiting and I was made to feel right at home. All the staff was very welcoming and professional. The food was delicious and I would definitely return and also bring others with me.The location is great and even the other customers were very friendly this place gets a A+ in my book",
            "Wow! It is so rare to get service like the service we received during a busy lunch hour, let alone any other time of day!  If I could give ten stars for the service at Grumpy's it still wouldn't be enough. We walked in the door to a packed room a little after 1 pm, but were seated right away. I had barely taken a breath before we received a menu and our drink order was taken. Another breath barely escaped my lips before the drinks were on the table. Kaboom!Although the place was packed and music was playing, it wasn't too loud. In fact, it was just right. It was too cool to sit outside, but we got a table next to the front door which may have helped a bit with the noise level. Either way, it was just right. Our food came out almost as fast as the drinks and it was piping hot. To say that the chili cheese burger was good is an understatement. It was out of this world delicious. And the fries were so tasty! Hubby really loves his sandwich and onion rings too. Honestly, Grumpy's was quite the find and yet another reason that Yelp is the best! Thanks to Yelp for getting us Grumpy and thanks to Grumpy's for an awesome lunch.",

Went in and sat down and shortly after were asked to move to accommodate a larger party.  We were happy to move but our server never returned. Sat for 15 minutes nursing my glass of ice water - server took the order of the large party next to us brought them fries and drinks and didn't even acknowledge our presence. Left and moved on to the Old Ship Saloon!",
            "This is clearly a locals/business bar, tucked away off the Embarcadero, which we wandered into for a late lunch after doing tourist things. Great service. The barkeep recommended the tuna melt. Well, having never had a single person recommend the tuna melt anywhere, we thought we'd give it a chance along with a Reuben. OMG. Best sandwich ever. (The Reuben was OK too.) I don't know what magic they're working, but keep it up! I'd go back in a second. Genuine little place with a great vibe.",
            "Before I had kids. Before I worked around here.Before i get into topic...The whole staff here are awesome people.As I was Born and raised in Frisco, this some what hole in the wall (which it isnt, its a pub) is at a best location (open to all). They Bring coworkers in and out to relax, take a shot, forget about today, etc.. this isn't a restaurant so theres no need to judge on food because you shouldn't expect a high end cuisine. If you are looking for that, go to the ones across the embarcadero st and spend your bougie money else where. They serve food here because they know you're hungry. Everything is basically American food. Beers are good, all liquour are poured equal, there are regulars and newbies, outside and inside seating, etc. Come to grumpys if you need a drink before you get on Bart and go homeCome to grumpys if you are hungry and thirsty during the lunch till 7pm. Also don't forget to look at the pictures on the wall before you go potty. :) Fyi: Don't come by over the weekends..",
            "So not a 4 Star experience - get real here peeps - dive bar with nothing on the menu that you can't easily make on your own stove in 10 mins. Place is 2 stars at best - filthy inside and service comes with an decently sized attitude. Can do much better here Grumpy - give your joint an update and begin to smile a bit more - dive bars can do that",
            "We love a great hole in the wall dive. Grumpy's looked to fit the bill, however, we were greatly disappointed. We walked in and immediately got a seat, which was great because it was lunchtime. There were loads of open tables. The server came over quickly to ask what we wanted to drink. We hadn't had a chance to look over the menu so asked for water. She brought it over and then asked if we could move over one table because they had a party of 10. No problem! She seated the large party, took their orders, brought their drinks and fries and never acknowledged that we were there. We sat for a good 15 minutes being ignored. We left! Feeling disappointed, angry, and dejected we found another hole in the wall. If Grumpy's can't treat a party of two well when they aren't that busy I hate to go during a busy time. Maybe only if you're a large party. Too bad we are huge tippers when we are treated well.",

            "Stumbled across this place on Yelp while looking for a spot to quickly grab some food and drinks before heading to the Exploratorium with my boyfriend. The place itself has a very authentic dive bar feel and a very friendly staff! We grabbed a seat at the bar on a Thursday evening right before Happy Hour ended and ordered a few drinks and a Pastrami Reuben with Garlic Fries. I don't know if I just super hungry, but that was probably one of the best Reuben's I've had! It was packed with lots of meat and great flavor. We were only planning on having one or two drinks there but ended up having quite a few more once we started talking to the bartenders and one of their regulars. Overall, we had really great conversation and a lot of fun hanging out at Grumpy's. I think we just found our new go-to spot. We'll definitely be back soon!",
            "Typical hole in the wall pub. I wanted quick food that would fill me up and that's exactly what I got. Burger was filling and beer was good. I was surprised at the wide array of burgers they had and were all $11-$15",
            "Randomly found this place on Yelp on a Thursday night. I wasn't expecting much but was surprised when we arrived. There were a ton of people there! I'm not sure if it was because of the Warriors game or if it's just a typical happy hour spot for people who work in the area. They had happy hour deals but we decided to just order off the menu.My roommate and I both ordered a burger and fries - I got mine medium, French style (bacon and blue cheese). Mmmm... the patties were thick and juicy. Great burgers! We also ordered Stella and Boont on tap. Total was about ~$40 with tip for the both of us. Would definitely come back.",
            "Came here for lunch on a Monday. Place was empty and somewhat clean. The Irish lady was the only person serving the 3 tables occupied inside. I ordered the chicken strips ($8.50) and garlic fries ($4.50). Well, based on my pictures, do you think it's worth that much? I didn't either. What else was disturbing is that she gave me the silverware from the other table that was left dirty. Needless to say, I didn't use the utensils. Then as soon as her entire family comes in the bar, she leaves. Not finishing or notifying her guests that she was serving earlier. Anyway, I'd probably come back for a drink or two, but to eat? I don't think so.",
            "Came here last Friday to attend my coworker's going away party around 1pm. The place was surprisingly crowded inside so we sat outside. we were a table of 9 and there was another table of 6 next to us. So there's plenty of seating outside. The server gave us our menus pretty quickly. Other than that, it took them a while to come back to take our orders. So one of my coworkers wrote what everyone wanted and brought it inside to our server. I've never been here before so I asked the coworkers for suggestions since they come here pretty often. They suggested the meatloaf sandwich. Having never eaten a meatloaf sandwich before, I decided to try it. When the food came out, I took a bite and thought it was just meh. The meatloaf seemed to be lacking in flavor for me. But the loaf of bread it came on was delicious. Perfectly toasted! The meatloaf sandwich also came with fries and those tasted pretty standard. We had a side of onion rings that I enjoyed a lot! Despite service being slow and inattentive in the beginning, after we got our food, our server came to check up on us plenty of times throughout the meal.",
            "I came here expecting to have a couple of drinks and a burger for dinner.  I had a scotch on the rocks, then left.It was late afternoon, and the place was fairly empty.  I sat at the bar and the bartender (who was in conversation with another patron) could hardly be bothered to come over to ask me what I wanted.  When he deigned to do so, ordered my drink but he didn't ask me if I was interested dinner.  He went right back to his conversation with the other patron.  While having my drink I had to tolerate two women (who must have flown in on their broomsticks) sitting next to me who work for a local media company.  Their not-very-subtle and not-very-quiet conversation was spent cattily ripping to shreds many of their female colleagues and external business partners.  In my ongoing effort to separate myself from poisonous people, I asked for my check, paid it, then left.My two star review was not impacted by the two women (the establishment has no control over their patron's conversations).  It is because of the indifferent, unwelcoming attitude of the bartender."

            "I am writing this review in hopes that the flavor and quality control comes back to Brown Sugar Kitchen. I was a fan of the original restaurant in Oakland. I was so excited when it opened in the Ferry building. I went on Saturday for breakfast. I ordered the fried chicken, grits and eggs, and a biscuit. The grits had no flavor. They lacked salt and the flavor and creaminess that I remembered. My chicken was not cooked through and I had to take it back. The staff was very gracious and fired up another order within 15 minutes. I ate one piece while I was at the Ferry building and it too lacked flavor. I took the other piece home for later, only to find out that it too was not completely done. The biscuit was the only thing that had any flavor. I hope that this was just a sign of growing pains and the food will improve.  Until then I'll let my memories of the old Brown Sugar Kitchen suffice.",

No coffee served means ordering from Blue Bottle two doors down ( $14 for three cups of coffee). Hassle. Although very tasty, $18 for a \"to go \" waffle with two small pieces of fried chicken is ridiculousThe same price with two boneless breasts might have been different. Beignets had potential but were underdone and served with a small portion of unremarkable raspberry jam. Ditto a cheese and bacon biscuit... also doughy inside. $4.50 each. Served with frozen butter of some kind(?)It was neither a reasonable value or a great meal... a shame given how good the Oakland location used to be.This is a typical example of a popular restaurant exploiting its reputation. Oh yeah... $60 for take - away breakfast for three and they wouldn't give us a cup of water.",
            "I really wanted to like this and I tried to go to her sit down restaurant in Oakland but the line was too long so I decided to swing by early at her Ferry Building location.  There's been a lot of hype about Brown Sugar Kitchen but this meal just didn't live up. I came here for Sunday brunch and ordered the fried chicken and waffle together with a mango La Croix. The waffle was soggy and the chicken leg and thigh were really small (basically kid's size). With tax and tip, this was $25 so a bit overpriced for what you get. It's a typical counter service situation at the Ferry Building but there's outside seating available next to the area. It's a disappointing meal. Not recommended.",

We need more chefs repping the Bay Area especially women of color. She seemed so sweet, humble, and I was drooling over her food on the show.When Chef Holland took over the old Il Cane Rosso space in the Ferry Building to open Brown Sugar Kitchen [Counter], I knew a visit would be in order. There's not enough black-owned businesses in SF, much less the Bay Area so I wanted to support the start of Chef Holland's empire (her goal is to go national).My excitement was crushed when friend and well-trusted Yelper, Lori N. told me that the food was not good.I refused to believe it and had to try it for myself. I was hoping her experience was a fluke but...she was right.Women are always right!On the menu:* Breakfast items (served until 11 am): Granola, Cheese Grits, Breakfast Sandwich, Fruit, etc,* All Day Menu: Fried Chicken & Waffles, Beignets, and Biscuits* Lunch Menu: Sandwiches (Fried Chicken, BBQ Pork, Catfish), Gumbo, Salads, and Sides (Slaw, Mac & Cheese, etc).It's SF and the Ferry Building so it's going to be pricey. I have no issues with pricey, as long as, the food is bomb.For $31.47 (pre-tip), I got a 2 pc Chicken + Cornmeal Waffle ($18 + $2 surcharge for dark meat only), Chocolate-Pecan Bar ($7), and La Croix ($2): bit.ly/2EofQzM. No water was available so I had to buy a drink.Counter service only and everything is packed as take out.Unfortunately, the food was sorely disappointing, and grossly overpriced for the quality and portion size: bit.ly/2Skappe.Upon receiving my order, I quickly went to their outside patio to start eating because fried food never travels well.The Buttermilk Fried Chicken was barely warm but good. Not $6 a piece \"good\" but good - flavorful, crunchy batter and moist, tender meat. I could taste all the delicious spices like paprika, cayenne, thyme, garlic, etc. The thigh and drumstick were very small though, probably organic.The Cornmeal Waffle made my heart sink. My coworkers raved about this and said, it was a must order (when the old Oakland location was open). The tepid waffle was a bland, soggy sponge. You can tell that the waffle wasn't even warm because the butter never fully melted. I was sad that I had to toss it after 2 bites.The meal was accompanied by a container of unidentifiable sauce. It was watery with a top layer of congealed fat. I later found out it was apple cider syrup. Bizarre that it would have a layer of cold fat on top.Since I made the trek out to the Ferry Building, I also got the Chocolate Pecan Bar which was unremarkable for $7. It was like a refrigerated brownie, hard as a rock.Overall, a grossly overpriced and very disappointing lunch. Also, something didn't agree with me so I didn't feel well afterwards and had to leave work early.I know Brown Sugar Kitchen is less than 2 weeks old and I try to be generous with new businesses but I expected much better coming from such a beloved chef with a loyal following and tried-and-true recipes. For Chicken & Waffles, you're better off going to Auntie April's in Hunter's Point for a much better meal at half the price.On the upside, I was able to escape the gritty Mid-Market area to have a quiet lunch with a waterfront view!",

The chicken was piping hot.  Very flavorful.  Hubby & I both got a good size breast and wing with drummette with more breast meat attached.  Moist and tender.  Hubby wolfed down his cornmeal waffle.  Orange zesty flavor.  Came with a little container of maple syrup.  Not too sweet.  A small dollop of butter atop the waffleWelcome Brown Sugar Kitchen to San Francisco.  Kudos to the first black owned business at the Ferry Building.",
            "This place is like a dream come true.  Delicious soul food served in a no frills counter service format, conveniently located in the FiDi at the Ferry Building.  Most everything I've tried thus far was delicious.  The lines do move a little slowly though, mainly because they'll often take a pause from taking orders for the kitchen to catch up.  But even still, it's not uncommon to wait an additional 10-15 minutes once you place your order.  So main point is don't come here in a rush and don't join a really long line (unless you like waiting in lines).Beignets: These were different from the chunk-shaped beignets I'm used to.  It's like someone made an empty empanada out of beignet dough and deep fried it.  And you know what, I really liked it!  Felt fluffier than the regular kind.  Plus the side of strawberry jam was a perfect pairing.Cheddar Cheese Grits w/ Poached Eggs: Just the right portion to satisfy your breakfast urges, but not make you so full you skip lunch.  The grits were smooth and creamy.  Could have had more cheese in my opinion, but I'm a bit cheese obsessed.  The poached egg had a very nice silky runny interior; more like a precise sous vide poach (...though not sure they used one) than a quick stove top poach.  Truthfully, I'd prefer the beignets if I could only choose one breakfast, but these are good when your sweet tooth isn't in charge.Egg Sandwich with Bacon: Tasty, but pretty generic.  Similar to many other breakfast sandwiches around town.  Their beignets and grits are much more unique for the area.  The croissant was fresh and flaky.  The bacon felt a bit limp.  The scrambled eggs were fine for scrambled, but a slightly runny fried egg might have been better.  Generous portion of cheese though.Breakfast Potatoes: Probably the only truly disappointing thing I had here.  Not that flavorful and not much texture going on besides pasty.  Your $5 is better spent towards a treat from the counter display.Chicken & Waffle: Apparently a signature dish at Brown Sugar Kitchen and now I understand why!  Popeye's fried chicken is my benchmark since many places (fast food and finer establishments) usually don't live up.  But not here, they actually exceeded.  The meat was super tender and flavorful, almost like it was slow roasted.  But it still had a nice crispy (though not too thick) skin.  The waffle was very fluffy with a few crispy bits.  The syrup wasn't pure maple syrup, but a lot less viscous and had some nice spices (which I couldn't quite figure out).  And they weren't shy about the butter at all.Smoked Chicken & Shrimp Gumbo with Rice: I don't think I've ever had a gumbo that was so meaty.  Like seriously, you could not dip your spoon in without hitting a chunk of tender chicken or plump shrimp.  There were also some okra slices in there, but thankfully they were not slimy at all.  Great flavorful broth.  And rice served on the side was nice and fluffy without any bits sticking together.BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich: Tasted about as good as pulled pork from a place that specialized in BBQ, which is surprising since this stand only has one BBQ item.  The meat was super tender with some firm ends.  Very generous portion.  Paired quite well with the coleslaw topping, which is high praise since I'm no coleslaw fan.  The bread looked hard, but soaked up all the juices and was quite soft and chewy.Macaroni & Cheese: Just kinda meh.  It's better than those coagulated mac & cheese blocks some places sell.  I appreciated that the macaroni was al dente and swimming in a creamy sauce.  It was sprinkled with a tiny bit of breadcrumbs on top, but seemed more for show than texture since it was the consistency of dust and in a very thing layer.  What this side was missing was a nice crunch on top.  Ideally that would be gratinéed cheese, but a generous portion of large crispy breadcrumbs would work too.Bacon-Cheddar-Scallion Biscuit: Nothing like those chalky biscuits you get at a fast food joints.  This had a layered fluffy interior and firm crispy exterior; quite a nice texture.  The butter and cheddar seemed generous.  The bacon was a bit sparse though, just a few bits on top.  Tasted amazing paired with the gumbo.Cast Iron Skillet Cornbread with Brown Sugar Butter: The pieces soaked in the sweet butter were amazing.  The rest was a little dry.  Decent overall.Sweet Potato Pie: Very thick slice, like double the height you find in most pie slices.  Wasn't overly sweet, but still sweet enough.  And the thick pie crust worked very well against the pasty filling.Chocolate Pecan Bar: More like a brownie with pecan pie filling on top.  Wasn't quite expecting this from the description, but it was tasty.Apple Hand Pie: Seems like a lot more flaky crust than apple filling.  Also, not as hearty as the other desserts I tried here.   Best to skip this, unless you've already tried every other sweet here.",
            "I was excited to hear that a Brown Sugar Kitchen was going to open in the Ferry Building. My coworkers actually recommended the Brown Sugar Kitchen in West Oakland (it's closed), but unfortunately, I don't think I would recommend this place to other people. At most, it was average and very costly.I ordered a Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($12). The chicken was a bit soggy after a couple of minutes of eating the sandwich. It was not as crispy as I expected. The bread was kind of plain. Some parts of the bread were crunchy while others were not. Do not expect the sandwich to be saucy. I thought the lettuce inside the sandwich was going to taste like cole slaw or something similar. It was actually kind of light. The Buttermilk Fried Chicken (2 pieces) ($10) were really small and filling. My friend was given one drumstick and one thigh. The thigh was boneless, which was interesting. It was drier than the drumstick. It wasn't too flavorful, so he had to add hot sauce to it. I think other fried chicken places, like The Bird, tastes better.",
            "When I arrived at the Ferry Building, I immediately caught a glimpse of the Brown Sugar Kitchen sign. My heart leapt in my chest and my mouth started salivating. It was a Saturday afternoon and the Ferry Building was heavy with human traffic.TIP: Don't be scared by the amount of people near the BSK stand-the bathrooms are right next door and so is Blue Bottle, so it makes BSK appear busier than they actually are.The fried chicken was incredibly tasty. The chicken was moist and the batter was crisp. The cornmeal waffle was different than any other waffle I've had in my life. The cornmeal gave it a much lighter and crunchier texture. I really enjoyed it, and would almost go so far to say it's even better than traditional waffles! The syrup provided is VERY sweet, so word of caution before you pour it all over your meal (which I did and soon regretted...). The mac and cheese was a smaller portion than I imagined, it only filled about half the cup that it came in. It wasn't mind blowing, so I would suggest going for something else on the menu.Overall thoughts: Really tasty meal that I would recommend. The service is quick and they offer a pager that will go off when your order is ready. It is a little pricey, but understandable for it being in the Ferry Building. Would 100% reorder the chicken and waffles but would skip on the mac & cheese next time.",
            "Overall 2.5/5, rounding up to 3/5, giving a new location the benefit of the doubt, with hopes for future improvement.What happened BSK?!? I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of BSK, since I hadn't yet tried their East Bay locations.  I love soul food, and with all the notoriety surrounding BSK, I was sure I was in for a great lunch... but left disappointed.After my disappointing lunch, I walked away assuming (and hoping) that BSK must've had a bad day, or that my experience was simply a one off.  I was still willing to give it another shot, because I so wanted to like it.  However, the next day, I read that Elite Yelper Cherylynn N., one of the most popular and respected Yelpers in the SF Bay Area, also had a disappointing experience.  Now I'm really left pondering, \"What is going on at BSK?\"Here's why I left disillusioned :Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Cornmeal Waffle ($18.00): Who could leave here without ordering their signature and claim to fame item, the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Cornmeal Waffle? Actually, now I wish I had left here without getting this. The chicken came out warm and moist, even the breast portion.  However, it was just okay, as it was accompanied with a bland coating of batter that was not particularly crispy.  Sadly, the mediocre fried chicken was the best part of the chicken and waffles entree.  The waffle was completely limp and cold.  When I picked up a piece, it collapsed like a thin slice of pizza that had been soggy after sitting out in a pool of oil. The waffle wasn't at all greasy, but it did come with their brown sugar butter, which came out as a small solidified dollop of butter with grainy sugar.  It was so solidified that it was impossible to spread on the already limp waffle that I ended up removing it.  Perhaps the waffle came out the way it did because it was either sitting out for a while before being served, or perhaps because it was packed in a take out container with a lid, which may have significantly softened the waffle.  Nonetheless, I was able to snag one of the few tables directly across the restaurant, and consumed the food within minutes.  I can only imagine how literally inedible the waffle would've been, had I waited another five minutes or eaten it in the car. Such a disappointment for their classic signature entree! If you're at the Ferry Building and come down with a fried chicken craving, you can get that need met here, but I'd make sure to get that order a la carte for fried chicken only, and definitely pass on the waffles!Smoked Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo with Rice ($12.00)The lukewarm gumbo was clearly doused with powdered gumbo file seasoning.  I'm actually a fan of gumbo file seasoning, but wanted to taste some seafood flavoring in the gumbo, which it was completely devoid of.  There was a good serving of chicken, but no shrimp to be found in the fairly small serving for $12.00.Spicy Cabbage Slaw ($4.00):  Bland, without a hint of spiciness, but retained some crunch.  Fruit Hand Pie:  Probably the best of the items ordered.  A good crust, not overly sweet, but not exactly overflowing with generous fruit filling.Note that this is strictly a takeout location:There is absolutely no seating inside the restaurant.  You can try to get one of the few tables inside directly across the restaurant, or one of the tables outside (far from ideal with the recent chilly wet weather).  With the lines that have been forming, snagging a seat anywhere may be a challenge, particularly during peak hours. Also, do yourself a favor and make sure your takeout order includes all the proper utensils you'll need.  Our order came without any spoons, which we needed for the gumbo.  It wasn't a problem for us, since we sat just a few feet from the restaurant, but if we had taken our food back to the car or somewhere farther away, we would've had to drink the gumbo directly out of the container, or scramble to find a spoon somewhere.  Why don't they just easily hand out pre-packaged utensil packets with napkins and all? It's nice to see the Ferry Building offering a wide variety of cuisines, for both locals and tourists alike to experience. Technically, BSK fits that bill nicely. That said, given the lesser food quality coupled with the higher price point, for what is essentially take out food, I'm not yet up for a return visit real soon, nor recommending it to visitors.  I really hope this newcomer to the Ferry Building steps it up and lives up to the recognition it has garnered across the Bay.",
            "First thing's first where is it in the Ferry Bldg? None of the early reviews really mentioned it in detail  so I'll try to help. It's at the end closest to the Golden Gate Bridge (or furthest away from Bay Bridge if you want to think of it that way).  Across from Slanted Door in an  aisle off the main corridor and near Gott's. (your welcome).  $18 for the chicken and waffle combo. So I wasn't the biggest fan of Brown Sugar in West Oakland. I went several times and I just didn't get the hype. Friends/colleagues loved that spot and I just didn't get it. Like that girl/guy in your college freshman dorm that everyone loves but you just don't \"get it\". I had them low ranked (bottom-tier) in my Bay Area chicken and waffle rankings but on my recent visit I bumped them up to the middle tier (see end of this review) so to speak.  Taste wise solid not spectacular and it's more a 3.5 star place for me. Yes, it's expensive but that's to be expected for any place in the Ferry Building.  I like other spots in the city more but given the convenience and central location I wouldn't mind paying a few extra $ for the chicken and waffles here which is why I gave it a 4 star review instead of 3. You absolutely have to pour the syrup on top of the chicken for you \"newbies\". Finally, I'm not a fan of their house cider syrup. But luckily you can ask for maple syrup which I and other like minded individuals typically do. Best to probably ask and try both if you haven't tried it before. Since I already used D'Angelo's  \"Brown Sugar\"  for  another review (which won Review of the Day).  I'll use another 90's jam from Boyz II Men to convey my feelings about my recent visit and my \"change of heart\" towards Brown Sugar.

            "I had really high hopes for this place. I had read many good things about their new location in the Ferry Building.  I had come on a Wednesday morning at 8:15am and ordered the bacon, cheese and scallion biscuit and two piece fried chicken breasts.  I took them to go and when I got to work, I was extremely excited to eat the chicken. I opened up the box and started digging in. I used a fork and a knife and noticed the batter was extremely soft and rubbing off. It was going on to my fingers and on the box and it just wasn't sticking. I went thru the breast and was so disappointed. It was juicy but the batter was all over the place. It was like it melted or something.  the biscuit was very good though. But I was there for the chicken!!!! I was so sad and I really really REALLY wanted it to work out for me. Unfortunately, it did not.",
            "A black-owned business located in the Ferry Building and it does not disappoint. My brother and I tried the buttermilk fried chicken and cornmeal waffle and it was hella good. So good in fact that my brother kept talking about how good it was and ate the chicken all the way to the bone ( which is the proper way to eat chicken btw). The chicken was hot and tender, fall off the bone worthy and flavorful. The syrup was quite different with unique flavors, but it was a great addition to the chicken. It's a definite must especially if it's your first time at Brown Sugar Kitchen. We plan on coming back soon to try more items on the menu and support a much-needed establishment in San Francisco. Its counter service, so there's limited seating at the location. However,  there is seating outside and throughout the Ferry Building if you can make it without inhaling your food before then.",

The corn meal waffle was delish!!!! The berry tart squares were amazing. The chocolate pecan squares were under cooked and more like fudge than a bar. I was really excited to try this place, will give it another try before I give up on them. Perhaps I will do better with the grits and biscuits?",
            "Was excited to try since I hadn't  been able to make it to Oakland. We got the 2 piece chicken and cornbread. The flavor of the chicken is pretty good, but just very poorly fried. Both drumstick and thigh were sadly soggy. Cornbread was good!",
            "I stood in line 10:45 a.m., placed my order for cornmeal waffle ($10) at 10:52, and got it after 32 minutes at 11:24. The staff were great, both frontliners and in the line kitchen. They were moving as fast as they could but maybe could have one more cook on weekends and two more waffle makers. The waffles are light and crisp on the sides and just as as good as I remember it. However, it was not hot and just barely warm and almost at room temperature and the size is not enough for a meal. It's for kids and adults who want to eat light. The syrup was a wee bit watery and not the same with what is in my memory. I  was patient and did not complain. The lady handing out  the orders gave me a hand pie berry for goodwill and that was nice. Had I known it would take that long and the waffles being not hot enough, I would have waited for Slanted Door to open at 11:00 a.m. and have a truly delicious hot meal. I was still hungry after the waffle but didn't eat the dessert.",

            "We went on a Saturday, so the line was long and slow.  Got a fried chicken sandwich which was just okay. The coleslaw was finely cut and did not have too much mayo (both pluses in my opinion) but it was otherwise bland and not at all spicy or flavorful. It was $12 for the sandwich, so you think you would get some nice meat but mine was half breast and half sort of back meat aka not really appealing in texture. Not the magic I was expecting after all of the BSK hype I've been hearing. It is better than Brenda's but honestly Shake Shack has a better fried chicken sandwich. Smaller portion, less expensive, more crunch. I kind of wish I could give back the calories and splurge on something else. The server was really nice and friendly though and the open-ish kitchen seemed really organized for only being at this location a few weeks. Don't think I'll be back though.",
            "I wasn't too impressed with the fried chicken sandwich. The sandwich bread was too soft and plain and the sandwich had a load of coleslaw. The chicken itself was just ok, nothing special. They should have toasted the bread and added extra coating to the chicken so that it was more crispy."

            "I love meat. Although I do enjoy vegetables, I can never become vegetarian. Especially because ribeyes exist....SIGH. 5A5 Steak Lounge is a trendy steakhouse that is half dining room half bar. Lots of people were coming in dressed in suits and dresses. Beautiful scene. But no need to wear a suit to come here.I honestly came here for the Japanese A-5 Wagyu Experience. Throughout the food scene, the term \"WAGYU\" has been misused and un-apologetically placed on menus to describe meat that it not from Japan. Unlike 5A5, they actually show you the \"Certificate of Authenticity\" before showing you a platter of Japanese A-5 Grade Wagyu. It was definitely my first time trying REAL Japanese Wagyu and was definitely excited for this moment. We had a few appetizers to start.  Not too impressed with the Lobster Tempura and Truffle Fries. It wasn't the flavor...I guess it was just standard. Not memorable.1) Prime Rib: Delicious. It was perfectly cooked and had the right amount of marbling.2) Dry-Aged T-Bone: I wished the steak was served plain with just salt and pepper. It honestly didn't need the sous vide egg, bacon jam, and demi glace. Too much was going on.3) Double Ribeye: This was enormous! Need to split this with three people. Again, i do prefer steaks just plain as is to maintain the integrity of the meat.4) The A-5 Experience: So this platter, we all shared to have a taste of each steak. It consisted of 4oz Wagyu New York Strip, 4 oz Wagyu Filet, 4 oz Wagyu Ribeye, 4 oz Wagyu Ribcap. Wish I didn't have to share. the meat was SUPPPPPEEERRRRR TENDER. Like literally the nice cut through easily. Aside from the tenderness, the meat had such a unique flavor to it. It had richness from the marbling and earthiness from the intramuscular meat. The platter is designed to eat leaner cuts first then climax into the marbled cuts. So NY first, Filet second, Ribeye, fourth, and Ribcap last. I almost cried.Conclusion:Go here for the A-5 Experience. It's expensive but it will be one of the best steaks you'll ever have.",
            "This is a long time coming.5A5 is actually pretty amazing. From the time I entered that night, I knew I was gonna get my fill of delicious cuisine. It's been quite awhile since I had balled out for food so I was looking forward to this meal. I was however taken back a bit with my experience because I had many mixed emotions after. So much that \"it\" too, led me to delaying this review. However now that we have finally come to the bridge, I will lay down the low down. The as part of it all is that, this \"should\" of been a 5 star review however there are couple things that I just couldn't tolerate. To start things off, I came here on Vday. Valentines Day is the anniversary of me and my girlfriend's relationship starting so it is an extra special day. I always pride myself on thinking up a master plan to making the day a special day. Sadly, this wasn't one of my best years on planning. I picked an air BnB that didn't pan out the way I wanted and on top of that me and my loved one got terrible sleep the night before. So I was counting on the dinner to be icing on the cake. I had called 5A5 a day before to see if they did anything special for anniversary's. Nobody so I left a voicemail with my name and what time my reservation was at. They called me back the next day when I was at the exploratorium and asked for my name and what time reservation. I was a little puzzled because I already had provided them that information but I called them and left another voicemail since no one picked up. After I prayed and just hope that someone would surprise us at dinner time. Friggin rain. Ugh...Me and my girlfriend exited the Exploratorium only to be greeted by pouring rain. We walked to 5A5 Steakhouse since it was only 4-5 blocks away. We arrived at 9:45 and I advised host that we were there. 10 minutes pass and we aren't seated. Another 10 minutes pass and still no word. Not even just an acknowledgement or apology for being busy that night. My girlfriend wanted water so I went ahead and got some for the both of us. After I came back to hydrate, I noticed a couple was getting a little restless; specifically the dude. He looked mad irritated lol. Real talk. You ever have that moment in public where you see someone act a certain way, but it's like looking at yourself in the mirror? That's how I felt.This dude went up to the host and was like , \"We had a reservation at 9:45. How long is it going go be?\" The host looks up at him, smiles, and proceeds to calm him down. Super professional. That is until she made one comment...And like the savage she was, she said \"You aren't the only one who is waiting for a table sir.\" An continued to smile. The announcer from Power Stone uttered two letters. \"K.O.!!!!!!!!\" LOL. Was this real life? I never thought an employee at such a nice restaurant would give a customer the business like that. He looked SO broken. This was almost like when Sonic Fox beat PerfectLegend 11-0 at Mortal Kombat all those years ago(Heck it might of been 13-0...). That was the devil in me. 5 minutes later the host sat us down and before she left said, \"I sat you guys down before that couple because you guys were more patient.\"  Lmao. It really does pay to be a nice person sometimes and just turn the other cheek. But then the angel side of me set in. This wasn't right. I mean. When you've worked in customer service for at least 10 years like I have, events like this eat at ya a bit. Yes. Maybe the customer was a little unreasonable because if he looked around, he could easily tell that 5A5 had been busy probably for hours. It was a full house when we got there at 9:45 and it never changed at any moment when we were waiting. Luckily I'm extremely patient person but even still ate me. The customer is always right; EVEN when they are not. So it is for those reasons above that my review will come short a little which kinda makes me sad because I really enjoyed the food. The Lobster Bisque was probably the best I've ever had and the Filet Mignon was to die for. Cook a steak with perfection and use my favorite wine as a reduction...? Stahp it. Even our server was extremely professional and friendly. Honestly the food and our server saved my experience here. But yet no one even wished me and my girlfriend Happy Anniversary...So in Conclusion, beware. It sounds like there some employees here that have a stick up teh buttocks. Which is really unfortunate because the food here is actually bomb. However that degree of unprofessional is unacceptable and I doesn't the kind of language that was said. I definitely would come back but if I got the same treatment that couple did, I'd seriously ever come back again. Hopefully others that try this place out won't see the Darkside of 5A5 Steak Lounge.",
            "food was just Ok but probably not worth the price. dinner for 2 turned out to be $370 all in.   i had the $70 tbone medium rare.  came out very rare.  i wasn't able to eat  more than a few bites before i felt kind of nauseated (in hindsight i realized it was super undercooked). sides of fries, mac cheese, mushrooms were also ok but not different than standard bar fare.    i actually took the steak home and a few days later broiled it in my oven and it was edible but not above average.",
            "If you're a steak purist like me, you should pass on this place. This place was uneven at best and their steaks disappointed. They began the meal by bringing out their cuts of wagyu. They looked delicious but I'm not about to spend $200 for a cut of steak. We did start out with their wagyu steak tartar. It was pretty good but I wouldn't say it's better than some of the best steak tartare I've had. We each got different steaks but all of them were doused in sauce and/or cheese. The T-bone was what was recommended by the waiter and so I got it with the sauce on the side. Unfortunately,  they forgot and covered it in their sauce which tasted like a lighter bbq sauce. The bacon jam was good but you really couldn't taste the flavor of the steak. A great steak place should showcase the steak and not mask it with sauce. The better part about the meal were the sides. The sweet potato gnocchi was surprisingly good. The sweetness of the potato and the saltiness of the cheese balanced really well. The spinach and truffle mac and cheese was decent. I did wish they had some not-cheese covered veggies to help balance the richness of the meal. We ended with the white chocolate cheesecake and whatever the chocolate dessert was. Both were also just okay. You can barely taste the white chocolate in the cheesecake. The tangy sorbet that accompanied it was the star. The chocolate was fine but not memorable (seeing as I can't remember the name).All in all, if you love traditional steak then this is not for you. If you want dressed up steak, then you'll find something for you here.",
            "If you have money to spend, and want a nice atmospheric dinner in San Francisco, this place might be for you.I don't think the food was very good for the price, but service was pretty good (waited a good 15 to 20 minutes between appetizers and mains but our server was very pleasant and even covered the corkage fee). The sides were okay, nothing to write home about. The amuse bouche of butternut squash soup was probably the table's favorite \"appetizer\". Some of my friends did actually go for the A5 cuts of steak and they were exactly as promised: melt-in-your-mouth goodness. You can pick between 4 ounces (currently ~$160 depending on which cut you get) and 8 ounces (currently ~$310). Another friend and I decided to just share a 32 ounce bone-in ribeye ($79), knowing we would be taking some of it home. Sadly, the meat was way overcooked for what we asked for (compromised with my friend and went with medium...it tasted more like medium well/well done). I don't know if I'd come back unless I had enough to spend on a nice cut of wagyu.",
            "It took me a week to decide between a three or four stars but I figured that if I'm this much torn, it should really be a 3.  It's like watching a boxing match where the undercards were much better than the main event.  Overall, the dinner was filled with hits and misses. The side dishes were fantastic, such as the Sweet Potato Gnocchi, Truffled Mac N Cheese, and Creamy Spinach.  Even the Bacon Bread was awesome, but the butter was not.  My main course, the Slow Roasted Prime Rib, was bland and under seasoned.    The chocolate dessert was good, but the cheesecake was very dry and not creamy at all.",
            "TRUFFLE MAC AND CHEESE YES. Holy shit. I wish I could just have ordered that and I would've been good. 3 stars for the meat ordered. I didn't try the 5A5 meats, because I'm ballin on a budget. BUT for a steak house, I expected the Prime Rib and Filet Mignon to be better. The Prime Rib was sooo fatty, like overly fatty. I could've gotten a better cut at Stinking Rose for half the price. Filet Mignon was great, but for the price point, it didn't meet standard. It wasn't amazing for $60. Appetizers were solid. The Sashimi platter was great, just tiny, but it's all good. Scallops were also tasty, but nothing super out of the ordinary. Get the truffle Mac and cheese tho. Holy shit f me up. Love that. Can I get 3 orders to go?",
            "I don't know about you but I'll feeling WAGYUUUUU. Taylor swift probably wouldn't step foot in this establishment or sing about wagyu but I just went there and I'm not taking it back.This classy establishment has a lot to offer to foodies visiting and living in San Francisco. Not your typical evening out, this restaurant boasts people celebrating special occasions. Their menu is nothing short of extraordinary and is truly a meat eaters haven. To be 100% honest with you, I'd never go here but I was invited to entertain clients here so I kindly said why not. So here goes a pescatarians review of a steak lounge - wish me luck. Our group started with cocktails and red wine. Nothing too crazy here but my coworker ordered the sangria for 2 cocktail which was served in a modern day potion bottle with foam embellishment. Quite fancy but oh so sweet and flowery I could barely choke down the sip I tried. However, she loved it. For appetizers, we ordered the shisito peppers (amazing), scallops (too fishy for my liking), and poké spoons (good but not extraordinary). They also have us a short rib mushroom taster along with the bread course, which was complementary. For the main course, I had the sea bass which was good but I was more impressed by the side dishes we ordered for the table. The sweet potato gnocchi was bombbbbbb and I wish that was my main meal. We also had super yummy asparagus, creamed spinach, mushrooms, truffle Mac and cheese, and candied bacon mashed potatoes. The meat eaters were thrilled with their selections. A lot of my table opted for the tbone which was the size of a small dog no joke. The few that opted for the wagyu were absolutely mesmerized. I think they went to heaven and back for the short 5 minutes that it took them to finish their dish. All smiles after the main courses, and my smile was still focused on how to get the sweet potato gnocchi recipe.An ambitious table mate wanted dessert so we ordered the chocolate mouse and the poached pear. Both good for a bite or two but I think we were all comatose still from the previous 3 hours of indulgence. Overall a great fancy dinner spot for entertaining. The staff are on top of it and courteous. They definitely make you feel like a million bucks. And they probably will treat you 10x better if you order the 300 wagyu because their tip just went up quite a bit.Probably won't be back unless work is paying but I would recommend again if needing to entertain clients or out of town guests with no budget!",
            "Food: Got the Dry aged T-bone medium rare (3.5/5). Not giving it 5 stars because the meat quality was just not there. The filet part of the T-bone was great, but the strip part was a tad tough. Found myself chewing pieces for long periods of time to be able to swallow it. The bacon jam though... Was delicious. I wanted to spread it on everything and take some home. However when you get a steak, it's not about the sauce it's about the quality of meat and the steaks flavor. Got the Scallops (5/5) too which came in a broth that was delicious. I wanted to get a straw and suck it all up but I was told that would be weird. Clearly was with the wrong people. Service: 4/5 which is what you expect at a high end restaurant. Was a little hard to flag someone down to get us a fork as we were short one for our salads. Enjoyed them packing our food for us.Sidenote: They have a happy hour with some food and drinks on it if you are trying to save some money.",
            "We spent a wonderful evening dining for our extended 25th anniversary. Small hour plates we loved. Steak is too perfection.  Staff is how I like it,  attentive.. All in all we ate coming back..Happy campers",
            "I came here with my boyfriend for a date night. Our server was a young brunette and was super charming! She was really helpful explaining the different cuts of Wagyu. We ordered the Wagyu beef carpaccio which we really enjoyed and seared scallops, which were really soggy. I don't recommend the scallops. We had a palette cleanser which was similar to a light-smooth fruit flavored gelatin as a palette cleanser which was also pretty tasty. I really enjoyed the Wagyu. I had ordered the 4 oz and it was more than enough. The steak was buttery and melted in my mouth. It wasn't the biggest steak but it made me really full because it was heavy.The truffle mac n cheese was super strong in truffle and the white chocolate cheesecake was super dry... I wouldn't recommend. Overall it was a pretty great experience.",
            "Never had such great Waugu selection in my experience eating steak until now. Love the ambience of this restaurant and food was delicious.",
            "The food here was decent. I came with a large party so I got to try several dishes. First off it was a bit off-putting that pretty much all the sides and appetizers were covered in truffle oil. This included the fries, which were alright. I'd also skip the edamame - it was absolutely drenched in oil.I sampled some of the wagyu cross-breed steaks, which were actually pretty good. I also split the regular bone-in ribeye with someone else. The ribeye was massive and could easily be split 3-ways, but I found it slightly lacking in flavor.",
            "Went here with my girlfriend, 5A5's restaurant ambience is amazing. Both service and food were great as well. We both ordered a filet mignon and shared an A5 wagyu filet. The steaks were good - what you'd expect at a high end steakhouse, and the wagyu was absolutely delicious. It was really expensive, $375 for 2 (including tip and tax) but the experience of trying authentic Japanese A5 wagyu beef is worth it at least once in your life.",
            "On my last night of dining in San Francisco before I left for home the following day, me and my girlfriend were craving a good steakhouse dinner. After yelping, and looking at other sources it drove us here to 5A5 steak lounge. Was surprised to see as soon as we stepped in that the place was mostly empty. It did not discourage us, however was still surprised of that fact. A zagat rated, top 12 steakhouse was practically empty. Any who, the service was excellent. The presentation was very nice and now lets talk about the food.They start off with this bacon bread and butter which was definitely not laking the bacon flavor. We ordered a lobster tempura along with a spoon full of the ahi tuna. I wasn't crazy about either to be honest. In my opinion, a lobster shouldn't be fried but never the less was still tasty. We ordered a filet with sides for dinner. Perfectly cooked. I will say, if you have the $$ and want to drop on wagyu and truffles this is your place as the waiter told us it's one of the few places in the country that serves extremely high grade wagyu. I wouldn't not recommend this place to somebody. But for me, I would like to see what else is out there.",
            "I had dinner reservations for 9:30pm on Valentine's Day. We parked on the other side of the building, which is totally doable. After we checked in we were quickly seated at the bar. Our total wait time to get to our table was approximately 15 minutes. Once we were seated we were quickly served bread and water and we ordered our meal. We upgraded to the A5 experience for two, which replaces the entree on the vday menu. Overall the service was great, the food was great, and the drinks were good. The lemon drop was a staple but I felt like their Moscow mule could use a different kind of ginger beer for more of a kick. Crustacean duo - lobster was delicious, crab cakes had a strong flavor, the cucumber dipping sauce tasted familiar Shigoku oysters - I feel like the chili garlic salsa can make any oysters taste that great. I need it. Burrata salad - first timer, and it was interesting. Lobster bisque (not pictured) - rich and creamy but I wish it came out a little hotterA5 experience (4 cuts) - wow. Just wow. This has ruined steak for me. Wagyu only. Must try!Valrhona chocolate mousse cake - very rich! It's delicious but was too much for meStrawberry field - not a fan of the balsamic ice cream",
            "Yum yum yum. The tempura lobster was the most amazing thing I have ever eaten! Everything was great! Definitely coming again.",
            "Eating here was on my foodie check off list and the wait is finally over. The restaurant atmosphere was great, the staff was more than words can express. I do not remember our waiters name on Saturday night but he was indeed the best. I had the 8oz prime rib (medium) and asparagus with the Kyoto for my dinner whistle wetness. All delicious of course. This was the 1st of many visits to come. You should also make a visit if steak is your thing of not there's a fish and veggie option on the menu. Cheerio!",
            "When you chime into a conversation about steakhouses in city 5A5 is for sure to come up. I have seen many good reviews on yelp as well as friends vouching for it. I came here for a birthday celebration and to say the least, it was great. Our server Ben greeted us as soon as our table was ready. Mind you, our reservation was initially at 6pm but we called earlier to have it pushed to 5:30 and they were very accommodating.We started our meal with some appetizers-- truffle mac and cheese and a sashimi plate. Initially we were looking to order the wagyu sliders but unfortunately it was not available the night of our reservation. It's okay though, because the sashimi plate definitely hit the spot! My favorite of the 3 kind was the hamachi--recommended!!For the main course, my lady ordered the 4oz NY Strip steak and I was able to grab a small nibble. Delicious. For me, I opted for the 15oz slow-cooked prime rib and it was perfect! We ended the meal with a complimentary birthday dessert as well as mini madeleines to fill our little sweet tooth.Overall, 5A5 was everything we expected. Thank you for having us, cheers!",
            "Wagyu steak is the best of the best. The cattle are given beer and massages, and raised with exacting standards to produce rich, marbled meat that has no equal. Unfortunately, someone at 5a5 has decided perfection isn't good enough. They liberally slop flavored butter on the steak, to a point that should be considered criminal. It's an affront to all of the work that goes into the production of the meat. All I could taste was truffle oil, like what you might get at Costco. It's like adding Walmart flame decals to a Ferrari.Bad steak experience aside, the service was extremely inattentive. The restaurant was not particularly busy, but our server barely stopped by. By the time he asked when how our steaks came out, they were cold. The manager did comp my friends steak (it was pretty much a pile of butter). The restaurant does have a great atmosphere, and if they could just stop destroying perfection they might be on to something. But then again, anyone with access to that meat could probably do the same."

            "My boyfriend and I visited Hillstone as our one \"splurge,\" dinner during a vacation in SF. I picked Hillstone because it was fancy but not quite as expensive as other nice restaurants in the area, and it did not have only a prix fixe menu, which is hard to find in SF. I am so glad we chose Hillstone. The location is perfect. It's just a few blocks away from the piers, so it's not right in a tourist spot, but is easy to get to if you've been sight-seeing beforehand. I appreciated the dim lighting because it created a romantic and calm atmosphere. Our waiter was very accommodating to our questions about drinks. I ordered a French 75 (my favorite cocktail and not on the cocktail menu) and it was one of the best I've ever had. It had finely shaved ice in it, which was a nice surprise.My boyfriend ordered the burger, and he really enjoyed it. He said it was just like a classic burger- nothing fancy, but that's what he likes.I had the French omelette. It was without a doubt one of the best omelettes I've ever had, but most of my omelettes come from brunch diners. I was worried it would be too cheesey, as I do not like a lot of cheese, but it was just right. The eggs were silky smooth, and the fresh herbs added a lot of flavor. I loved the vine tomatoes in the salad, too.We also ordered the famous artichoke. The menu said it was gone for the season, but the waiter told us they had some for \"this night only.\" I wonder if they always do that so that people will think they're lucky it's there and buy it? I enjoyed it, but did not understand the hype. To me, it tasted like regular grilled artichoke.One thing that bothered me was that even though the restaurant's website talks about not being kid-friendly, we saw several tables of kids. The website also talks about a dress code and that men must either have a collared shirt or will be given one. I saw plenty of men without collared shirts, even wearing t-shirts. Obviously this is all fine- what other people wear and if there are some kids doesn't really effect my experience. But I was confused why they would put these rules like no kids and a dress code on the website if they do not actually follow them.",
            "I took my friend here for his birthday and we went all out.Started off with a strong cocktail, so strong that I forgot the name of it.For appetizers we did the chips with artichoke dip, thai steak salad, and red beans and rice. Everything was very good here, my friend loved the chips and dip because it was perfectly gooey and seasoned. The thai steak salad was refreshing and not heavily dressed. The red beans and rice was my favorite!! I would honestly come back here JUST for this. Oh we also had the shrimp cocktail, shrimps were gigantic but I am not sure if it had that freshness I normally would enjoy at an authentic seafood place.I ordered the porkchop because I've never tried porkchop before in my life and I thought this upscale restaurant would do it justice. Unfortunately my pork came out really dry that I could not eat it... I gave it away to a homeless person the next day.. I also did not like that it came with the cooked red cabbage, and the mashed potatoes were standard. My friend had the prime rib which was SO much better than mine I actually took a large chunk since I couldn't eat my dish. His also came with the weird red cabbage and a baked potato. Neither of us liked the cabbage... they should consider presenting other options for sides.I gave this place an OK because of the atmosphere, appetizers, and drink. They also had live music on a Wednesday night I think it was, which was a pleasant surprise that made the dinner that much better!Again I think I would only come back here for cocktails and red beans and rice... haha.",
            "I made a reservation for my boyfriend and I to come here and dine for our late Valentines day dinner. We were late to our reservation but called on the way there and they were still accommodating about it despite it being a full house. We were advised that we would have to wait but got seated 10 minutes after checking in. Everything was just wonderful. What we got: Spinach & Artichoke dip The Hawaiian Bone-In Prime RibI loved everything! My favorite was the entree I got(The Hawaiian). It was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and the pineapple soy ginger sauce was so good! I would highly recommend this place. Plus, it's right near the pier. How much more romantic can that get?",
            "Receptionist and waitresses are warm and professional . They are good looking and very upbeat.",
            "Color me impressed!  If memory serves, this place is by the same folks who own the fantastic Rutherford Grill and R&D Kitchen in Yountville (and many others). The food is fantastic and our server was one of the best I've seen in a restaurant.  I highly recommend the burger, kale salad, and the spinach-artichoke dip.  The restaurant is clean, spacious, and not too noisy.  It's a great place for business meetings.  I'll be back.",
            "I'm in love with the Hillstone. The food is delicious, the ambiance and live music is romantic, and the service is top notch. Prices do reflect such. And while parking can be tricky, it's worth the time and scouring. A quick breakdown:Food- 5 stars. I usually have their artichokes and crab cakes. Order the crab cakes before they run out for the day!Ambiance- 5 stars. From the music, to the decor, and the formal attire dress code... come here for special dates/occasions or if you just want to feel fancy!Service- 5 stars. Staff is super duper attentive.I'm deducting a star bc they no longer serve parties of 8 or more.",
            "Yes, a chain, but ...Hillstone is located across from Pier 33 on San Francisco's Embarcadero, where Houston's used to stand. It features an outdoor patio with a fireplace (near the entrance) that comes very handy in the cool evenings of San Francisco. There is a large bar where one can have drinks and order food. Should you sit for a meal at the dinning area, you will enjoy good food served by very well trained staff. Earlier in this paragraph I mentioned Houston's. It wasn't until a few days ago that I learned that both Houston's and Hillstone are owned by the same group. Not a problem and here is why, chain or not you will get good service and fine food and cocktails.There were four of us on this visit, each of us ordered something different and all of us came out happy and satisfied! I enjoyed my Mt. Lassen Cajun Trout. It was nicely seasoned and grilled and the size of the dish was just fine for my liking. My friend who was sitting next to me ordered Barbecue Pork Ribs and he let me try a piece; I loved it!Good food, good drinks and good service in very nice settings for a reasonable price. What else can you ask for?",
            "Stopped in for a quick business lunch the other day and we decided to sit at the nicely situated bar. The staff was prompt, friendly and attentive and helped us with our order right away. I ordered the grilled chicken salad and a side of focaccia bread and they were both delicious! The focaccia was seasoned with sea salt, herbs and had some nice olives on the side. Really good bread! As for the salad, the thinly sliced chicken and peanut sauce was easy to eat and super flavorful. It was a little on the expensive side but, it's SF and a $24 dollar salad is pretty pr for the course. Crazy huh? Anyway, consistent flavorful food and service with a smile. Great option given the limited options in the area.",
            "Hillstone is hip, classy atmosphere and across from the ferry buildings, just a walk from Pier 39. I walked from BART which is a long stroll in the sun.I came in on a weekday lunchtime and was seated promptly as I beat the rush before noon. Whether you chose to sit inside or outside, you cannot go wrong. I have been to nice restaurants before and felt ignored, but that was not the case here. I was also served water, a menu, and my meal promptly. The waiter was able to tell me about the sides so I could make a perfect selection. I had to try the Famous French Dip Au Jus. It was savory and delicious. I usually eat half a sandwich and save the rest. I was able to eat all of it since the bread is not heavy. Served on a French roll, I can taste a buttery hint of croissant. The soft bread is not overly done nor hard. The roast beef was tender and juicy, a good portion of meat was upon the roll. It came with the dipping juice and horseradish that has a zesty bite to it. I made a wise choice to go with the tabbouleh with lemon vinaigrette. I could taste the lemon among the little rice , white corn, mint, and onions, and tomatoes. Definitely a healthy, lean choice.",
            "Let me preface by saying that I love the Hillstone Restaurant Group. I've been going to their restaurants all around the US for the last two decades. This restaurant doesn't need another review but it's me and why not.I don't get a chance to come to this area of SF often since you need to take the F-Street Car or make the long walk from Embarcadero. I have lately when I have to come to SF and I'm so happy that this is one of the few restaurant choices because I love this place.They serve great American food with a refined touch. I love that even after all these years they have their standard favorites like their Spinach Artichoke dip, Thai Beef Noodle Salad, the return of the Flying Chicken Platter, and hot fudge sundae. I've tried their fried chicken sandwich which looks beautifully presented and tastes as good as it looks.Service is always great even on a crowded lunch time rush. At night, the trees outside have lovely lights and it's a romantic ambiance.",
            "The jazz trio was playing a set comprised of the Charlie Brown Christmas Special pieces as we walked in.  My first reaction was--wow, they're good.The volume was perfect too.For as much as I dislike booths, we were seated at one but I have to admit, they were comfortable and quite large.We were a party of four and my left handedness was not an issue for me or my dining partners at all.  (Ask any left handed person and they'll tell you how important seating is to them--we're constantly bumping elbows with the right hand world!)Drinking Bulleit Manhattans while listening to light, live jazz in a nice restaurant in SF (after a hellish week) was just what the doctor ordered.SF still has the ability to surprise me.  So glad to have finally dined at Hillstone.I read so much about the mustard/honey dressing that I ordered it with a beautiful salad.  It did not disappoint.  The bacon and egg in the salad paired so well with the dressing.This came after we also ordered their famous artichoke/spinach dip served with warm tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream.  They replenished the chips upon request for no extra charge.  Delicious.We ordered 2 servings of the rosemary foccacia bread too.  Three pieces for four diners was odd--they should have added an extra piece.My French Dip was served with the usual au jus, and they also added a small bowl of horseradish sauce which I alternately dipped my sandwich into.  I opted for the coleslaw as my side. Both food choices were perfectly seasoned.  The roast beef was tender and the roll was perfection.Others ordered the Flintsone sized Prime Rib.  Wow--it was a huge piece of meat served with a huge baked potato.  They loved it and were happy to also receive a small pot of au jus that they could add when needed.Salmon was also selected by another diner.  It was a good sized piece and cooked perfectly as well.We shared an apple pie cobbler with vanilla bean ice cream for dessert.Had a nightcap there and then called it a night.Dinner for four:  $400 before tip",
            "One of the best meals in San Francisco.  We started with the smoked salmon, then we shared the Prime Rib and a salad.  All were excellent, the prime rib was cooked perfectly and the vinaigrette made the salad.  Our server was friendly and very personable.  The live jazz was awesome and a very nice bonus.",
            "UPDATE:We come here several times a year. Normally we order the artichoke dip with chips before dinner. On 2/16/2019, while we were waiting for our table, I observed the Manager grab a handful of chips, place them on a plate, and hand them to the waitress. He also touched the phone, the menus, cash and the continued to plate the chips with his filthy hands!!!Needless to say, we did not order our favorite dip with chips for this reason!My entire party of 8 were disgusted by this as well!!What happened to food safety and handling training?  Were they not trained? The waitresses also used their filthy hands to grab the chips people were consuming, totally unacceptable!!!! The French dip is so incredibly delicious! Love the atmosphere, they have live jazz music, and the waiters are very attentive.",
            "I am so happy that hillstone brought back blue cheese stuffed olives for their dirty martinis. It makes me come here way more then I should. You can't go wrong with this place. Service is always A+ and I have never had a bad meal here. My goto is always the ahi tuna, crab cakes or the kale salad. The ribs and the French dip are also probably the best ones I've ever had in the city. Make sure to make a reservation through Resy ahead of time, and come early to listen to their jazz music, sit at the bar, and have a dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. On a nice day you can also eat outside but that is all first come first serve. Love you hillstone and please don't ever get rid of blue cheese stuffed olives again! You're one of the only places in San Francisco that offers them and it makes this girl soooooo happy! Ps- there's no more free corkage, I think it's $20 per bottle now.",
            "My wife and I met some friends for dinner before a show and had an amazing time. The service was exemplary and the food was excellent. Everything each of the 6 people in our party wowed us. I ordered the French Dip sandwhich which had the most amazing thin cut slices of prime rib in a delicious bread with a side of dipping sauce and horseradish. I skipped the dipping sauce and used the horseradish and asked for sriracha and had the best sandwhich of my life. We can't wait to come back, drink more cocktails and try more of Hillstones menu items.",
            "Really solid upscale American. Very attentive service and great food. I went here for lunch and this place did not disappoint. The service is very good, and the quality of food is excellent. The quantity?  Excellent as well. I had the special - the BBQ burger and it was outstanding.  Great tasting meat and fresh bun with lots of cheese and bacon. They do not skimp on toppings nor food here!They have a full bar and outstanding service. Attentive with the aim to please. Don't sit by the kitchen...you will drive yourself crazy with all the great smells of the food!Good food and great service defines this spot. Well done!",
            "Hillstone has a little something for everyone, at a price that feels like it's paying for the decor. You'll be nestled into a leather booth, feeling like you should be having a business meeting.After an event, my friends and I stopped in and were seated quickly. There was a mix of people in suits and a ton of children with their families.I got Ding's crispy chicken sandwich ($20), which comes with baby Swiss and dressed kale. It was tasty, but far from the best chicken sandwich I've ever had.One friend got the flying chicken platter ($20) because the name was amusing. Her chicken tenders were also fine but unnoteworthy.Our other dining companion picked the Hawaiian ($40), a full ribeye steak with pineapple-soy-ginger marinade. I took one bite and was instantly reminded of kalbi, the Korean marinated beef short ribs. He did wolf it down, so perhaps the heartiest option was the best one.If you need a convenient place to eat that has a little something for everyone, Hillstone could be your place to go.",
            "I had heard great things about this place, especially the specific item I ordered. Decided to go for lunch and try the Thai steak and noodle dish. Maybe I caught them on an off day but it did not live up to its reputation. Heavy dressing made it soggy and the portion size was disappointing.",
            "One of the best restaurants I have been to. The food was great and the service was amazing.Starting from the appetizer to the dessert was wonderful.Make sure you call and reserve before you visit!",
            "Easy to get a reservation and the restaurant is in such a great location! My friend and I weren't too hungry, so we both ordered salads for lunch. The salads were quite large! And we were pretty full after eating them. The only thing that was disappointing was that I asked for my dressing on the side, but they said they couldn't accommodate, but they could make the dressing lighter. Sure, that's fine. When I got my salad it seemed drenched in dressing (luckily it tasted really good still). I'm not sure if they didn't go light on my dressing or if what I got was light, in which case I'm very concerned as to what the amount normal dressing would have been. Either way, I finished my whole salad and consumed probably a little more calories than I would have liked."

            "One of my favorite places to get work done, have good food and enjoy a drink on a weekday by FiDi. This place gets waves of customers during the say; it's a popular healthy (aussie-style) lunch spot, so from 1 to 2 pm on a weekday you can see lines of working professional forming to get some food and drinks. It can get a bit loud, too, so it's a great spot for focusing and doing work but nor great for taking conference calls or any work-related calls. They also have wifi and outlets, so you can camp out here for a few hours if you are in your zone. Pro tip: get a matcha latte with oat milk and the salmon toast. Delicious.",
            "Alright, I finally ended up on Yelp to do a review after my experience today.  I typically visit this location every Saturday after my appointments downtown.  Usually, they are good with service, attention to detail, etc.  Today, was just completely off.   I ordered avocado toast with 2 poached eggs, to eat in.  I bussed the table my friend and I sat at (if you go in, please bus your own table.  There's a spot to do so and it's not that hard).  We sat and talked and then my order comes out:  in a to go container, with my second poached egg in a cup of some sort.  Not entirely sure why the second egg wasn't on the actual toast, or why I got a to go container (specified we were eating there, coffee came in a glass).   So, already wasting non-reusable items when it could've been on a plate, plus it's easier to eat that way. Now, here's the part that made me write this.  I cut into the eggs and into the toast,  I have two hard boiled eggs.  Nope, not poached.  Instead of complaining I ate it, whatever- an egg is an egg.It's the overall experience.  Lack of attention to detail and not making sure the cafe is clean and picked up for other guests to enjoy.  I'll give it another try, as I know everyone has an off day.  If this is the new norm though, I'll take my business elsewhere.",
            "I was about to write a 1 Star review after the fiasco of this place last time when I was in Washington DC, where I didn't get a simple toast until 25 minutes later after I finished my coffee and the latte art got ruined by overpowering amounts of chocolate powder. I decided to give this place another try with the free coffee ticket they gave me for the inconvenience. I decided to check out their Aussie iced latte since after some research, this is an Australian inspired coffee shop. I got it with oat milk, and overall, I really liked it. Same goes for the salmon toast, where all the ingredients are fresh and they put it into a very nice takeout box, similar to when you pull something out of a drawer. It's pretty cute I guess.This time I am far from disappointed. I really enjoyed the food and drink as well as the customer service. I would go back again sometime, when I decide to splurge a little, because this is a very pricey place that would have set me back $19+ if it weren't for the promo and free coffee. Thanks for giving yourself a second chance; you earned back a customer :)",
            "Espresso the way it's supposed to taste, not the corporate way.  Delicious small meals like smoked salmon on whole grain bread.  Fresh-baked goodies.  They do not take cash so be ready for that.",
            "Solid avocado toast and affogato, but truth be told I've had better.In terms of toast I still prefer Mazarine - to DIE for.And affogatos - I didn't think I'd ever be crazy about any affogato because it's literally ice cream with espresso but I absolutely loved the one at Kona Coffee Purveyors (Hawaii).Cute cafe, and a nice option in the FiDi area for coffee!",
            "I docked a point out for cleanliness. While waiting in line to order, my coworkers and I were in the front and saw the sample food area with all the pastries filled with MANY MANY fruit flies. There was a sign that says it was used only for display, but it seemed like the food was there for days and felt pretty gross. Hopefully they switch up the food more often because it made me hesitant about how sanitary this place really is.First impression is that this place is boujee, but I like how modern and bright the atmosphere is. It feels very open and friendly.I got the Salmon Toast ($9) and the Matcha Latte ($5.5). I enjoyed the toast a lot. It came in this fancy looking blue box and made the experience feel special. I like the smoked salmon and the cream cheese was super delicious. They gave a lot of cream cheese too which was nice.The latte wasn't really my thing because it wasn't sweet enough. But my coworker liked the matcha sweetness and says that's how taste is like in Japan. Moreover, the toast was OK pricing, but the latte was pretty expensive for that small cup. I'd recommend passing on the drink.",
            "Came here per the suggestion of a friend and ordered an Americano for about $5 before tip, which is expensive. It was a decent Americano though. My friend had the avocado toast and an iced coffee for almost as expensive. I guess you're paying for the location. The avocado toast was yummy and served on good bread, which is a plus, but is it worth the price? Meh. The atmosphere is nice, though, and has such great colors for being right next to an alley of homeless people. I don't know if I'll ever choose to come back, but it could be a nice place to have coffee with friends that isn't Starbucks.",
            "Aussie homesickness cured? Tick. Having seen the other (lesser?) branch I was intrigued to see if the original venue could do better. Coffee was flawless. No problem. Vegemite toast? The server asked if I wanted butter - heresy to any Australian. Vegemite *must* be consumed on buttery toast. After that hiccup... remarkably good. Perfectly toasted sourdough, thick without being tough or chewy. They know their stuff here - despite the butter aberration.",
            "I went here twice over the weekend. 1. The coffee is great. If you're a blue bottle fan (I am), this is equally good. 2. I also tried the matcha latte on the second day that I went here, it was good. 3. My favourite here was the avocado toast. Nothing complex, simple bread with generous spread of fresh avocados served with salt and paprika drizzle on top. My only minor complaint is that they charge you $1 extra for making your drink extra hot. I find that a bit strange. Else the place is a definitely worth a stop to grab a small bite or get a coffee.",
            "Decided to treat my Aussie boyfriend to an Aussie coffee and snack. He ordered an iced latte (American iced- not AU iced) and avo toast. I ordered an Australian iced chocolate and banana toast. His coffee and toast were excellent, while my drink was good but toast was subpar. I was disappointed with the ambiance; there was just too much happening design wise, so it wasn't relaxing. The other thing that was disappointing was the messy tables with crumbs all over.",
            "If I had to review this place based on the people I'd give it 5 stars. The people were very accommodating and patient while I asked questions on just about every foreign menu item. They also were quick to clean unused or finished plates. There was a long line at first, but once the line started moving, everything went really quickly. The service was great!Unfortunately, I cannot say the same things about all the food. It was extremely overpriced and some of the pricing modules didn't even make sense. I got 1/2 of an avocado toast and a small yogurt with granola for $16 dollars, when a full avocado toast is $8. If a full avocado toast is $8, then 1/2 of an avocado toast should be $4, right? Then the rest of the meal.. a small yogurt and granola costs $12? It just didn't make complete sense, but I was hungry so didn't really care. Th avocado toast was ok. I actually didn't even finished it because it wasn't anything exceptional. The yogurt and granola was really, really good though! Maybe not $12 good, but good enough to finish the whole thing and feel satisfied (although I'll need another snack in an hr or two). I also got an iced coffee. It was good. I'd come back here, but not for the toasts. There are definitely other things on the menu I'd like to explore (like the aussy latte!",
            "Great spot to catch up with friends over coffee and brunch in San Francisco Financial district. Love their ambience. The interior is so tiny, bright, modern, and Instagram worthy. Also, the coffee and toasts are amazing!!Ordered for 3 ppl:Drinks：Latte: (4.5/5):  good quality coffee beans.Golden Latte (?/5): Not a big fan of cinnamon, and no dare to try a sip. ://Food:Avocado Toast (5/5): The best in the town!!! Love their avocado Toast recipe, fresh smash avocado seasoned w/ lemon juice, salt&pepper , chili flakes &olive oil!! The roast of toast just prefect. Tips: I would like to add some extra on the top next time, such as prosciutto or poached egg. Salmon Toast (4/5): according to my friends' comments. It tastes good but too creamy. Breakfast Bowl (4/5): kale, avocado, cherry tomato, red quinoa & poached egg. Hmmmm.. I can feel the healthiness from the breakfast bowl. Maybe few drop of lemon juice would make the salad bowl taste even better. Croissant (5/5): yummy! Crispy and buttery. Very match with the latte.",
            "This is the right one of these coffee spots to visit as they do a full breakfast menu. I think the breakfast bowls are amazingly good, the coffee is spot on, and I enjoy the fact that they open at 7am for those of us with some jetlag who skipped dinner. I come here pretty often, and look forward to staying downtown so I am nearby.",
            "I've tried this place a few times for breakfast and I consider it one of my go-to breakfast places when I want to treat myself. Cute little venue, great quality (and fairly healthy) food, nice and attentive staff, slightly pricey menu. I've tried the signature avo toast (with and without poached egg), Australian iced coffee, salmon toast, raspberry almond croissant, chocolate chip cookie, and the lemon blueberry muffin. The toasts are the best thing you could order. Steep price at $9, but it's honestly the best toasts hands down. The bread they use is fantastic in texture with a great balance of chewy, fluffiness and a nutty, toasty exterior. The slice is actually pretty large in size, cut thick, and placed in a cute little box. Both the avo toast and the salmon toast are tasty, but between the two, I prefer the avo toast. Both are pretty generous in toppings and are great quality, but I enjoy the flavors more in the avo toast personally (creamy, citrusy, spicy). The egg is great, a worth-while addition. As for the pastries, I enjoyed them all. The raspberry almond croissant was the most beautiful and my favorite of the three although it was a little too sweet. The lemon blueberry muffin is my next favorite for the simplicity in flavors and sugary, crusty top. The cookie was meant to be eaten with coffee, not on its own which made it less appealing for me since I don't always get coffee. I ordered the Australian iced coffee just because I was curious to know what it was and didn't bother to ask. It's vanilla ice cream in a cup of iced coffee! Actually really great, but not something I would order in the morning often. Overall, a great little cafe worth trying. I'll be back, especially for the avo toast.",
            "Nice place for a coffee! I went in with the purpose of getting a latte but decided to go for the mocha instead. The mocha was good, enough chocolate and coffee taste. Glad that it wasn't too sweet ! The one caveat is that the place isn't large and doesn't have much seating. Every time I've come the place is quite full and here's always a line. Usually it doesn't take too long but other times it does. Either way, I've always had a good experience coming in and I'd recommend the mocha and the latte. I love that they serve milo, didn't know it was popular in Australia as it is in South America. Will be back!",
            "I passed by this gem of a place on my way to work one day and decided to try it out.  There were a ton of fancy sounding coffee/espresso options on the menu that I as a coffee noob didn't know, and I unfortunately was in a hurry and didn't have time to ask.  So I opted for an old faithful, matcha latte.  The latte came out in a couple minutes and was delicious!  I'll definitely be back sometime to try the toast and their different kinds of coffee drinks.",
            "I've been to one of these in NY so I was excited to try the one here. I went for brunch/lunch with my friend on a Saturday at 12pm. It was starting to empty out, so we were able to get seats. Tables are pretty close together, so seating is a bit tight. I ordered the Market bowl (~$14), which was the same as the Breakfast Bowl (~$14, which my friend got) except had beets, corn, and cucumber. It's a little pricy and something I could make at home, but I do like the combination and it was plated very nicely. My only thing is that while pretty, the avocado did not seem ripe enough yet, and did not taste ripe either. A bit expensive for what it is, but I would come here again for a healthy brunch.",
            "The first Bluestone Lane I ever tried was in the Financial District in New York and now I'm so happy to see Bluestone Lanes popping up all over the place - even here, in SF! I dropped by on a Friday morning for some avo toast and a golden milk latte. I hadn't had one of these since New York and I was really craving a delicious turmeric drink! Overall, I was pleased by the service (which is amazing!) and the ambiance of the store. It looks lively but also not too much so, as people are able to get their work done in here. The price point is again, quite steep but it's to be expected here in San Francisco. I'd love to return and try some of their coffee here next time!",
            "Card Only! A friend and I ordered the Avocado toast and Salmon toast and both were good! The salmon toast was full of flavor and I found it delicious: It's served on one bread but it's super fulfilling. Definitely will come back and try something new off the menu!",
            "A little piece of home (Melbourne) in SF - complete with tins of Milo and Vegemite. And Melbourne prices too... sigh!"

            "Rainforest Cafe for adults!!One of the most unique experiences I've ever enjoyed in SF, and much better value than some others (e.g., Lazy Bear, which I also love but is very pricey). When you arrive at the venue, you walk through a rainforest-like room and are greeted by the hostess, who checks you in, hands you a welcome elixir (in our case, a kombucha made from Japanese flowers), and hang out until it's time to eat. Before dinner, we enjoyed drinks from the non-alcoholic bar, which offers a a broad variety of herbal drinks and snacks. We opted for a couple kava cocktails, both of which were delicious.Your ticket includes access to either LMNL, a series of rooms with varying AR/VR exhibits, or The Unreal Garden, an AR/VR exhibit with work by six different artists. Between the two, The Unreal Garden was by far more impressive, and very philosophical / deep in a way I wasn't expecting. Dinner was good though not mind blowing. There are five courses: - salad (carrots)- soup (salsify)- entree 1 (alaskan halibut, the first catch of the season - amazing!!!), - entree 2 (beef)- dessert (ginger asian pear sorbet)Each course has a vegan option. I don't eat beef, so opted for the vegan alternative for entree 2, which was a nightmare to work out with online customer service but was easily handled on the day of with the help of the conscientious waitstaff. Chef Nick Ronan is really passionate about his work, gave a speech midway through dinner to explain the concept of dinner, and came around and spoke to all the diners during the meal.Overall, couldn't recommend highly enough for a special occasion.",
            "Really amazing sensory experience! The team definitely put a lot of work into the design and ambiance as well as the food. I really liked the fish and the filet mignon, both were very tender and not dry. I would say my only real points for improvement are to have more light on the dish as sometimes it's a little hard to see what you're eating and the ginger-pear sorbet could have a stronger pear flavor.Great grand opening though, and if you didn't know if you buy the FEAST ticket, you get free access to LMNL and the Unreal Garden exhibits so it's definitely worth going to!",
            "First of all, what an amazing location. I've never experienced anything quite like F.E.A.S.T. From the moment we walked in and were escorted to our table by the super friendly staff, I knew this was going to be something special. The projected light show blew my mind! Such creativity. The five course meal was DELICIOUS along with the wine pairing. If I had to pick, the Filet Mignon was my favorite but everything else was just as yummy. It was neat to see Chef Nick Ronan interact with the guests. You could really feel his passion. This is truly a unique dining experience that you do not want to miss. I highly, highly recommend checking F.E.A.S.T. out!",
            "This is a one-of-a-kind dinner experience!!!  Guests arriving at the amazing Onedome are checked in by a friendly host, given a flower corsage, a welcome elixir, and are invited to explore the amazing museum-like facility, which includes LMNL, a labyrinth of interactive video and art installations unlike any I have seen before (think Burning Man meets SFMOMA).  But the REAL dining experience starts when you are asked to join 30 other diners in a single long table in a room garlanded with flowers.  The table itself is a giant projection mapping surface that you can interact with.  Over the next hour and a half, we received five sumptuous courses, each one designed to harmonize with the visuals on the table and the music playing -- all of which represent the flourish of spring.  Acclaimed Chef Nick Ronan from The Pawnshop comes out from time to time to explain the dishes and lends a very warm and intimate feeling to the night.... The meal starts strong with a carrot ensalada, followed by a creamy soup in a champagne glass, served with a shot glass of crunchy goodies.  Third course is an halibut on polenta and incredible sauce.   Four course is volcanic - in appearance and taste -- and the dessert I don't want to spoil as it will delight your taste buds.  Full vegan options are available, menu is gluten free and nut free - a quite an impressive feast with excellent service and next level artistic integration.  Meal includes two glasses of wine or beer, and wine and NA elixir pairings are available too.   This is really the next frontier of dining, a MUST!",
            "This was spectacular. More, more, more!  Atmosphere, food, hospitality, visuals, drinks.  Perfect night out :)",
            "I grew up in San Francisco and really appreciate the fine dining experience that is available to us here.  But, Feast at Onedome was unlike anything I have previously experienced and it was fantastic.  First of all, the location at Onedome is off the hook.  That place is beautiful and their bar is very cool.  Once seated for dinner be prepared to eat really well - we had a roasted veggie salad starter and then a spring pea soup, a light sole in cream sauce followed by a beef tenderloin main course and finished with a sorbet desert. Each course had a vegan option and all the dishes were made with taste AND health in mind.  I couldn't believe the server when I was told there was no butter in anything.  Wine pairings were great and the menu is prix-fix, so not many choices to make.  I could just sit back and be entertained by the projection light show on the table and talk to my dinner companions.  Service was spot on too.  Attentive but not disruptive.  A very special night.  I will be back and recommend Feast to anyone looking for a modern and different spin on dinner with friends.",
            "This was truly a one kind sensory experience mixed with a culinary adventure. First off, this space itself is creative and beautiful. We had the option of going to LMNL which had trippy, fun, and interactive art installations; an absolute must. This was followed by an elegant yet playful and visually interactive five course FEAST. The service was excellent. The presentation was beautiful and I enjoyed each course; the flavors were vibrant, unique, and fresh. The meal was paired with wine or beer per your preference. Overall, I can't say enough good things about Feast and Onedome. It is perfect for a fun night out with friends or a significant other."

            "I hosted 14 people to a private dinner in the Cellar Room and it was phenomenal!   I had guests from diverse parts of the country...including North Dakota, Nevada, Ohio, Florida and Hawaii!    I also had 2 vegetarians in the group.The booking experience was exceptional.   Sarah T. was responsive and accommodated all of my requests without question.My diverse group of co-workers and clients loved the setting.  It was indeed the cellar, surrounded by shelves of wine in an industrial, rustic and yet classy all rolled into one.   It was cozy, intimate and a great setting for good conversations since there was no ambient noise you generally find in larger restaurants with open floor plans.Our waiter gave the group his personal attention and answered all questions and was accommodating to requests without hesitation.  I had him pick the small bites for the whole table but let each person pick their own entrees.   This worked out well.  Appetizers were brussel sprouts, shishito peppers, croquettes, cheese plates and crispy pork bellies.  This satisfied both vegetarians and meat eaters.  We all picked our own entrees.   I chose the wild boar, some had the trout, a chicken breast, a pasta and others.  The current theme was West Coast. Without exception, everyone loved the small plates and everyone raved about their entrees.   Both appetizers and entrees were of good portions, flavorful, bold and worked in harmony with a red cab that was recommended by our waiter.All in all, a great experience in the Cellar Room for a group or team dinner. I will definitely recommend this place and will do it again without hesitation next time I'm in town.   Maybe they will have Italy or Spain on their menu...Jim",
            "Penning this review somewhat pains me, as I know how wonderfully curated this establishment's wine list is. Truth on paper, in simple terms, nevertheless!Ordered two glasses of wine at the bar. Barman begrudgingly friendly. One of said glasses was what one may refer to as a \"not inexpensive, subtle, expressive Napa Cabernet\" with which I am very familiar. Had to request a Bordeaux stem rather than the thimble-like apparatus placed upon the bar. No problem, one thinks, wine will make up for that!Said wine obviously open for several days, and not up to snuff. Mentioned to barman. Advised that the wine was fine (one is rather foolish to presume that Oswald would be none the wiser on matters of drink), and refused to open another bottle. Told to order something else!Understood is the desire not to waste, but when a place such as this, claiming to specialize in all things vinous shows such an attitude, one isn't too pleased. Had planned to stay for some enlightening dinner fare, but the grubby attitude of the little man at the bar, along with the grill \"master\" releasing a deafening sneeze upon a steak put me right off the trail!",
            "Came here for SF Restaurant Week and was not impressed. Very understaffed and the food was disappointing for the price. We had Brussels sprouts that were soggy and chocolate cake that had bacon on it (there was no mention of it on the menu also a very strange combination)Definitely good for drinks/cocktails but would not recommend for anything more than that.",
            "Pricey and mediocre. Mediocre ambiance, service, and food. Not the best combination. I'll admit that the hostess was welcoming when we arrived and seated us right away, since we had reservations, but the server who brought us our entrees had such a cold demeanor. When she brought us the bill ($65 tax included for two people for lunch), she didn't even say thank you and she didn't say it when we walked by her to leave. We even said thank you to her out of politeness. I guess she and this establishment don't care very much for their customers.On to the ambiance (or lack there of)...the tables are incredibly close together that you're about to bump elbows with your neighboring diners if you aren't careful. Everyone looks a bit uncomfortable and packed in. We made reservations early (before noon), so it wasn't very loud, but fast forward to noon and you won't be able to comfortably hear the person across from you. And did I mention that it was freezing in here when we first arrived? It really does take on the atmosphere of sitting in a barrel room. On to the food. We ordered the Salisfy Croquettes (5/5) and Brussels Sprouts (3/5) as starters and then the Fried Chicken Sandwich (4/5) and Smoked Salmon Salad (2/5). I asked for chicken on the salad instead and they were flexible enough to substitute ingredients, so I was happy with that (or so I thought). The Croquettes were the only dish that stood out to us as being unique in any way. They were perfectly fried and flavorful that my entree salad to follow was just disappointing. My chicken breast was dry and the texture was rubbery like it didn't do well in the sous vide machine. The arugula was overdressed and the fennel was pickled for way too long. If you choose to come here, go with the fried food as I think that's their specialty. That and a rude staff member.",
            "My friend and I entered the bar. Sat at a table. Few minutes later, a waiter approached. I spotted his Russian accent and asked  if he spoke any Russian. The rude guy looked down upon us and responded: \"Yes, I do. Do you have another question?\" We left. Can someone teach him some manners?",
            "As a sometime wannabe social drinker (but certified super level 100 lightweight), the wine was good, but the food really sealed the deal for me. We started off with some fries, poke, and vegetable bourguignon. The fries had this light crispiness on top of them and were perfectly golden. I love fries, but these really stood out for me. They were so fresh! 5/5. The lemon aioli that accompanied them was great as well. The poke (spicy) was made with large chunks of tuna. 4/5. I've had better wonton crisps, but the tuna was good. The veggie bourguignon was deep in flavor and satisfying. 4/5.Next came the steak, brussel sprouts, and house made sausage. The chimichurri sauce complemented the steak wonderfully with a strong herbiness. There was a bit too much fat on the steak, however, but it was perfectly medium rare. 4/5. The parmesan and bacon flavors really enhanced the brussel sprouts. 4/5. The polenta that came with the sausage was super buttery-- I was definitely scraping the plate by the end. The sausage was solid as well. 3.5/5.We were having a wine tasting event here. Our host for the evening, the owner, Sarah, was super knowledgeable about the wine-- it definitely is an educational (almost academic) experience-- she incorporates both science and history into helping you understand how wine is made and why it tastes the way it does. Even though I'm not much of a wine drinker, I always enjoy the learning. 4/5.Venue-wise, however, the space was not ideal for a private event. Although we had the room to ourselves, the bathroom for the main restaurant space was situated in the back and people kept coming in and out (which was okay), but then cut through the private space to leave the restaurant (when there clearly wasn't enough room to do so). A sign indicating that there was a private event taking place would have been helpful. 1/5.",
            "I like the laid-back ambience, but the meal was less than satisfying for a few reasons. We were short on time, so we ordered something easy to prepare - poke appetizer to share and two salads. The salads were tasty, but more like a starter. We thought the poke would be more filling, but unfortunately it was incredibly salty and not balanced in flavor. I may give it another try, but I don't have high expectations. I think if they just paid a bit more attention to the quality of the food, they could really improve.",
            "Pretty chill little bar in fidi. Place is kinda small so o probably wouldn't bring a big party here, but cool if you're just coming with a few people for happy hour. We got the peppers and croquettes during happy hour (half off). Peppers were good. I didn't eat the croquettes, but my friends all said it was amazing.",
            "Came here for a mid-sized group (6 person) dinner before a fancy evening out. My favorite thing about the place is the atmosphere. It's a tiny dining room, so it's not too loud -- and the wine lining the walls makes for a nice feel as well.The food was fine but nothing to write home about given the price. In addition, the restaurant was pretty terribly understaffed -- it was hard to get attention.Curious to go back and check out the wine bar that I believe is downstairs, but won't go out of my way to return for dinner.",
            "Awesome food, service and environment. We went for dinner during my bachelorette weekend and we all pleased! I ordered the mushroom pasta, and loved the flavor. My friends ordered the pork belly and the gnocchi--all good. We were all especially impressed with the brussel sprout appetizer. I also loved their wine list and tried the Rose flight, then selected a glass from the flight. The service was amazing--our waiter answered all questions and was friendly as well as informative. I would absolutely recommend this place for drinks, dinner and ambiance!",
            "If you are looking for a place that has completely random discrimination on the menu, The Barrel Room might be your place!Told us they were no longer seating at 930pm even though Google said open until 11pm and their sign said dinner until 10pm. We only wanted to stop for a cocktail and a snack. After leaving we called and they said they were open for drinks for another forty-five minutes.",
            "cheese tray $22.00. bread was hard as a rock, it could snap a tooth. cheese was minuscule. other dish, Brussel sprouts were room temperature but maybe that's how they serve them?? we spent a decent amount of money for not so good food temperature and quality wise. wine flights were great. cocktail was unique also, those saved the night, i'd skip the food though.",
            "I really enjoyed my time here. We tried a few different flights of wine -- which added a nice buzz. And, treated ourselves to entrees and some shared small plates. Everything was presented well and tasted good and fresh. I can't remember exactly what we got -- and it seems they have a rotating menu, but it was all good (not great, but solid). Just keep in mind they serve European-sized servings here; don't expect an entree to be enough. Bottom line: A nice night out if you wish to splurge on yourself a bit.",
            "Food was great, but service was terrible. We were a large party, but I don't think that excuses waiting 20 minutes for a drink. For the ambience of this restaurant it was regrettable how crappy the service was.",
            "5 Stars for amazing wine, food, service, and ambiance!As another review has mentioned, they rotate their menu and selection of wines and we lucked out with their current focus on southern France. Wine: Our server was very knowledgeable about the wines and gave us good recommendations based on our tastes (reds and roses). I had a lighter red and my partner had a full-bodied rose, which was from tavel - would definitely recommend this special wine.Food: we decided to share:-the medjool dates (4) wrapped in bacon and encircling chevre cheese and marcona almonds. FANTASTIC. -the brussels (without bacon) pretty standard but a good helping and accompaniment.-the French cheese platter: the blue cheese (roquefort) was the least favorite, and the platter came with a freshly sliced peach instead of preserves. We enjoyed the marcona almonds as well.-The Nicoise style tuna steak: we ordered this because the poke was out for the night. I really enjoyed it, along with the buttery potatoes and greens.Service: We were looked after well, but not obnoxiously. Our server had good recommendations for food based on the wines we chose, and split everything up for us nicely, brought us new plates, etc. He also gave us tastes of another wine towards the end of our meal.Ambiance: Tables were big enough and spread out enough that we could have an intimate conversation. Although it doesn't look like it from outside, the restaurant had high ceilings and felt very open.",
            "Good but overpriced. We loved the wines and the delectables. Boar two ways was nice as was tri tip and gnocchi. Atmosphere ok, not as elegant as price. Easy to do better in SF.",
            "I was here for a private event and can't wait to come back the next time I'm in town to have dinner or drinks.  This is a cool place that is lined with walls of wine and beautiful hardwood floors.  The basement level features private seating and a table inside a vault!  The appetizers served at the event were great.  Lots of tasty options, including mini quiche and stuffed figs.  Service was great and the wine was flowing.  I'm sure this place is popular because people kept trying to come after work and were disappointed to see it was closed for a private party.",
            "Small place with drinks that were pretty expensive. Dark with not a lot of seating. Drinks were mediocre.",
            "Made a res for 4, tried to cancel but they didn't pick up the phone. We didn't want to get charged so we showed up and got some brussel sprouts and two whiskey flights. Flights were great - they have selections from all over the world. Brussels were pretty good too. Service was rude and not helpful (a bit condescending when we said we were just in for drinks...). Prob won't come back again unless it's for HH.",
            "Came here for lunch was surprisingly impressed by the food. I wasn't expecting much and wanted to try something. I got to sit in their wine room, which is really nice. PATATAS BRAVAS-crispy yukon gold potatoes, salsa brava,-good flavor, but wished it was a bit crispierCRISPY BRUSSELS SPROUTS-brussel almond pesto w/ bacon-good flavor also, but it wasn't cripsy, which was ok since there was good texture from from the bacon and almond. BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN-mustard greens, pickled sweet peppers, dijon aïoli-so yummy and love the fries it comes with. Pretty big portion."

            "I was visiting SF and went here, which was near my hotel, for a double-expresso midday caffeine joint and wasn't disappointed. The espresso was rich and flavorful and to make things better it only cost a little over $3. Glad I passed the local Starbucks on my way to this little gem.",
            "Chocolate chip scone with lemon was nice. The scone was buttery and really tasty.  The speck, egg, avocado panini was just ok. The bread had a great texture, but the sandwich itself was pretty bland and almost tasted like smoked salmon. It was a bit meh for San Francisco. Great little area that wouldn't be so great if it was rainy and super cold. Very nice service.",
            "This is actually one of my favorite spots in the city.  It truly feels like a hidden gem, as it's not visible from the sidewalk.  You have to walk down a little brick alleyway to find the adorable stand and outdoor seating area.There's plenty of seating, lots of greenery and brick walls, quiet, peaceful and amazing coffee!  They serve sightglass (yum) and make a mean latte.  I have also tried their orange chocolate scone, and it's fantastic.  Would even go out of my way to come here and order the scone and a coffee!Baristas are super friendly and quite chatty.  They clearly have a following of loyal regulars (a good sign).  Prices are standard, nothing out of the ordinary.A review really does not do this place justice, you have to go and try it for yourself!",
            "Welcome to Silicon Valley - essentially a little cafe cart in the middle of an office building's patio. There were all sorts of conversations happening while I was there which sounded like they should be on the hit HBO show. Seating was ok - I found a table relatively easily. But it was in the entrance of the alleyway and only had one chair. The entire 'cafe' (which is, a patio) is uncovered so it may not be the best place on a windy, rainy, or exceptionally chilly day.Also note - aside from coffee, the other drink selections and food options are pretty limited. I gave it 4 stars since it's not 'bad' but it's not the most practical unless you're looking for a quick coffee fix outside.",
            "Nice spot for coffee in Jackson Square. There are several coffee shops in the area, but none have the ambiance of this cafe, which is essentially a coffee kiosk with outdoor seating nestled in an brick building alley way. They use Sightclass coffee serve a great cafe au lait and mocha, which is made with Guittard chocolate so it's a real treat. If you work in the area, retreat to Jackson Place Cafe if you want to have some coffee in a chill atmosphere.",
            "Love this place! The booth is nestled in an alley with outdoor seating and gas lamps. The owner, Giovanni, is extremely nice and accommodating. I was on the hunt for a breakfast order and found this place. I tried calling but the phone had a busy signal (I later learned that the phone is disconnected) so I walked over to place the order. I spoke with Giovanni who was more than happy to help prepare my order for Thursday pickup. After I got back to the office, I learned that we needed to change to a lunch order so I walked the two blocks back over and asked him to scrap my breakfast order in place of a lunch order.I ordered a mix of duck confit, prosciutto, and vegetarian paninis with fruit salads. I had to text him a few changes in between the time I placed my order to pickup and he responded promptly. My order was all ready to go when I arrived for pickup. The duck confit was a big hit. Super tender, huge portions. The prosciutto was good too, not very salty but the duck confit was definitely better. The fruit plates were amazing. Everything was fresh and organic and the portions were a lot bigger than what I was expecting. Everyone kept asking me where I got the food from. Definitely would come here again.",
            "This is an amazing little hidden treasure of Jackson square. The staff are always smiling and chatting with the regulars. They serve sightglass coffee and have a nice shaded patio to sit.",

            "I decided to stop by here, and get some work done before my next onsite meeting. The place itself looks really cool, but it's entirely outdoors (in an alley), so it gets really cold.  I ordered the house special Blueboon Drip Coffee.  It was cool, no complaints, but nothing I'm dying to get again.  But this place does not have wifi! What coffee shop doesn't have wifi nowadays?  Get with the times!  Needless to say, this hinders people from being able to hang out longer, do work, and order more drinks/food.",
            "Discovered this place by accident with my dad while we were walking down from the Little Italy district. We were in desperate need of a cup of joe, so we decided to check this joint out. First thing I love about Jacksons is the setting. It's located in a courtyard surrounded by brick buildings giving it a vintage vibe. They have some chill music playing in the background which adds to the relaxed, vacation vibes they have going on here. I ordered an almond milk cappuccino which I dare to say is the best cappuccino I've ever had. Main reason for this bold statement is because of the immense creaminess of the drink. I believe that's due to the type of almond milk they use: Califia almond milk. The milk is sweet, creamy, and smooth which is a rarity for a non-dairy based cappuccino. To all of my dairy-free friends: come here for the best cappuccino your tastebuds will ever meet!",
            "It was a decent place. They ran out of eggs when I went there, but they made delicious alternatives. Their sandwiches are decent. I'll go there again.",
            "Cafe au lait (drip) coffee (they use Sightglass coffee).Thank goodness they don't heat up their coffee with scalding hot water with scalding hot milk!Great flavor!Small drink menu, so nice to have.Super chill patio cafe, definitely not touristy.Be patient as it was one person working there after 2p.Would visit again to support local business!",
            "Okay. When you're walking around Embarcadero before a job interview, you want a solid cup of coffee to do the trick, right? Well, I'm so glad I popped into this little cafe, because it's located in the cutest little hip/start-up-like/hidden hipster brick building getaway... And they're actually pulling good espresso here.I came in around 2pm and they were out of their cold brew, so I settled for just a simple iced latte. Seems like they use Sightglass Coffee here. The lady rang me up and made my latte on the spot. I grabbed it and took a seat around their little plaza to catch a few breaths.I had no complaints. Not overly sweet. Light soy. Good espresso taste. Nothing bold or rich or \"in-your-face.\" Just very easy to drink and refresh.And, with the nice palm trees surrounding and brick alleyways with hipster-looking globe lamps, the ambiance was perfect. Well, for any hip and young San Francisco business person or start-up worker... It's trendy. But it's casual. And it's open to everyone. I'd want to grab a coffee here everyday if I could! The ambiance and decent coffee is KILLER. I'm a fan and just one visit was enough to make me craaaaave another trip here!",
            "Love this cafe! Located in a cozy courtyard surrounded by offices, this is a peaceful place to get some reading done or have a casual business meeting. Totally feels like a secret tropical rainforest because there is natural sunlight and greenery but everything is kept cool by the surrounding buildings. Order food and drinks at the little shack in the middle of the courtyard then have a seat at one of the small tables or pieces of lounge furniture. I got the breakfast panini with prosciutto, egg, and avocado. Super tasty and would recommend. I also got the iced coffee. Packed with caffeine. Both made the perfect breakfast combination as I got some work done for an hour.Oh and note that there are no electrical outlets or WiFi so unless you come here with fully charged devices and a hotspot, bring a book or friend to just have some quiet time away from the bustling of the city.",
            "Tucked into a plaza that is surrounded by brick offices is Jackson Place Café where urban professionals stand in line for coffee, pastry or panini.Why you search for JPC (+'s):+ Groovy hideaway. Sit on the patio furniture and escape the street noise.+ Awesome service. They've offered to comp me on my scone when the Square device was failing.+ Grilled chicken panini is satisfying. Grilled to perfection with a nice mixed green salad. $10.+ Pastries prepared by Batter Bakery and always freshly delivered.+ NYT and San Francisco magazine are available to peruse.Why you pass JPC (-'s):- Breakfast paninis don't really grab me. I've had better values than at JPC.- When it's cold or rainy, I find it hard to eat in the open space. Take it to go.Overall great little spot if you are looking for something mellow and easy.",
            "This cute little place is tucked away in an alley. Came here because I was running late to work and my office is just upstairs. Wanted the speck sandwich (which they were out of). Second time that's happened already. Not sure if they just say they're out or just don't have the products to make it since both times I've ordered it, it was in the morning. Hard to believe that they're out of items that early. So fine. Since they were out of the speck sandwich, I ordered the Rosemary ham, egg, and Gruyere sandwich on ciabatta bread. The barista repeated my order and went on to make the sandwich. It wasn't until I got upstairs that I saw that she made my sandwich using whole wheat bread instead of ciabatta. In addition to the sandwich, I also ordered a parfait. It was filled up halfway with yogurt and various fruits. Remaining half was for the container that held the granola in it. Yogurt was a little runny. Definitely not what I'm used to. Maybe it was the brand that they used? For 7 dollars, it didn't seem worth it. But I've had the coffee before and it's great because they use Sightglass coffee!",
            "Really cute place and more importantly, the service has always been consistent and the coffee and any of the breakfast items have been really good. In addition to that they carry cookies from some of the local bakeries which have been tasty little treats. All the breakfast paninis have been solid and no complaints there!",
            "Seemed okay- great coffee and location 3 stars because it's nothing I was impressed with. The service was a bit mediocre. At first I didn't think the person who served me was aware I was in line to make a purchase. But it's a cool spot to bring friends if you are in fhis area."

            "This place radiates nothing but good vibes. After galavanting through Chinatown, we stumbled upon RM 212. It looked really nicely decorated, so we decided to stop in. The place was trendy, the music was good, and the employees were extremely inviting. We were immediately greeted with warm smiles and decided to grab a seat at the bar. They have some awesome beers on tap, but I was super excited they had ciders, because they're hard to come by. The cider we tried was absolute perfection. Crisp, fresh, and not too sweet. I wish I had this on tap at my house.As for the food, we didn't get to eat here, but the guy next to us was raving about how good the hand rolls, shrimp, and sweet potato samosas were. We're definitely stopping by before our departure to make sure we get to try the food first-hand. The best part of this place are the people running it. The owners, Patrick (and I didn't get the other guys name) were so sweet. Great conversation and genuinely awesome dudes. They gave us some awesome recommendations on places to go and what places to stay clear of. And, they even hooked it up with a shot on the house. Thanks for everything!",
            "Foie gras wontons on the menu but they don't serve them anymore? The nachos are good. Korean fried chicken is \"very spicy\" (according to Anna). I found them durably spicy. Not super high in volume but it went for the distance. Sweet potato samosas were... Ok.Service was quick.Was a little put off by water that was in container at table. My mind wondered how long it had been there and if it was fresh. Just my two cents.Also... There was a couple to the left of us. The woman left abruptly while the check was being paid. The man followed shortly after. What happened? Did he say something? These are the days of our lives. Bye!",
            "The grumpy reviewer strikes again!Let's see. The sake was good, so there's that. The service, while not warm, was attentive, and everything arrived promptly. That's a big plus. Where to start on everything else. The ambience leaves a lot to be desired. Weird lighting choices combined with stupid TV screens. Gross. Toilet seat broken in the bathroom, which room doubles for some storage. A very dirty, and not needed, floor slick when wet warning sign in the dining area. No evidence of a functional heating system-we had to dine with our coats on! Electric cords strewn everywhere. All that wouldn't matter as much of the food was amazing, but we did not find it so. Points for trying to be creative - I love that, but being creative doesn't mean really tasty automatically. And the calorie to taste benefit was the poorest with the fried wontons filled with foie de gras--neither the addition of ginger nor the deep frying did anything to enhance the goose liver. In fact, the foie de gras was less tasty. The mango dipping sauce was definitely a miss. The tuna tacos promised a lot but didn't deliver, like so many politicians. The shrimp was fine, and the Brussels sprouts a highlight. I tried to order the sake flight but was told that was unavailable. Half the fun, gone. They have a good amount of fake cocktails, made with soju. Go wild if you want, but not for me. Give me real cocktails or go homIt was expensive in the end too, for the satisfaction of eating mostly just ok food in our coats, drinking not cheap sake. Meh. The owner or manager has responded below. A few points. I made observations and then made my preference. I don't like fake cocktails. I get the liquor license regulations which are unfair to proprietors. It wasn't raining, and even if it was, please clean the warning sign. No response on the broken toilet seat. Storage in the bathroom is probably unavoidable but detracts from the experience. No comment on the lack of heat on a very cold day. Maybe two 50s year old gay men aren't the right demographic because our internal thermostat burns cooler? I don't think my comments were unfair, they reflect my experience and I gave examples for each praise and complaint (there were both). Obviously people are going to like or not the food, and probably just portions of the menu. I don't believe in complaining about how food tastes at the time and sending it back to be wasted. It was certainly edible. And how did he know that I had the Nigori?",
            "I'm a personal fan of asian fusion and seeing the latest restaurant spinoff of classic foods but I couldn't tell what cultures rm212 was trying to meld together.We started off by ordering off their happy menu for drinks and got what the waitress described as a soju drink that tasted like a lemon drop ($6). We asked for the drink to be served neat and it came on the rocks instead. The drink was very diluted and didn't taste like much besides leaving the burning taste of soju as it went down.We got the korean fried chicken, xo string beans, & honey aioli shrimp. Nothing really stood out to me and the food was mediocre at best..on top of that, this is a tapas restaurant so the servings are small and around $12 a plate. The shrimp tasted like normal candied shrimp such as the ones from panda express; they were good but there was no hint of asian fusion and way too expensive for what it was. I was most excited about the kfc as it was the prettiest dish but that was probably my least favorite. The kfc had a weird seaweed aftertaste, was a bit too spicy, and didn't really have the sweetness that I like about the dish. The xo string beans were actually better than expected! They were juicy albeit a little spicy and limp.The restaurant's super tiny and only has maybe 5 tables and is dimly lit with neon fixtures which does make for a cool ambiance but I won't be coming back again. For the price of the dishes I would have expected something of better quality.",
            "We used yelp to find this place while on vacation in SF.  We were a little scared because we went on a Saturday night (around 7:30 which was right for us, but apparently early for locals) and no one was there - literally, we were the only ones.  We got a little worried, but decided to stay put.  Glad we did.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and the food was fantastic. The lamb pot stickers and cauliflower were perfect.  And the drinks were all hand made (including the mule ginger syrup) and went down a little too easily!  The straw was the only governor from those getting out of hand.  By the the time we left, it was packed, so no doubt this is a solid place for locals in town.  Check it out!",
            "If it wasn't for the YELP recommendations and reviews, I wouldn't have gone inside this little restaurant that from outside it seems to be a small bar tucked away on a side street in SF Chinatown. The tapas style Asian fusion dinner we tried here was amazing, what an experience?!! Why is t there a line outside this little restaurant which has about 10 tables?!! Great news was, we didn't have to wait to get seated for a party of fiveWe ordered the Korean Fried Chicken, Crab Sliders, Corn Fritters, strong beans, bugogi nachos and butterfish tataki. It was plenty of food for 5 people. Every dish was a pleasant surprise with a nice mix of Asian touch/twist to an original dish. Loved the crispy wontons inside the nacho dish. Butterfish was smooth and soft, corn fritters were nice and crispy and not oily. Crab sliders was awesome. Not sure if I had a favorite dish here. Everything was great!!!!By the time we were leaving the place was packed and seemed the cocktails are a hit as every table was ordering a lot of the mixed cocktails (we don't drink and can't comment on that but must be good that everyone was ordering various cocktails). Seems they opened two years ago and the chef changes the menu each quarter, we will be back in January for tasting the new menu items.",
            "Honestly I don't know how this place has almost 5 start rating. Only tapas/ appetizer that was OK was the sausage baos. Everything else was meh. Who the hell makes BULGOGI chicken. It's OK to be fusion as long as you do it right. The food was subpar.",
            "I came here with a big group a few weeks ago and I am pretty sure we ordered everything on the menu. Bulgogi Nachos? Check. Butterfish Sashimi? Yup. Spicy Fritters? We got two. Oh, and those pumpkin samosas... I wasn't kidding; we truly did get everything else they had. Those were the few that stuck out to me. The nachos were fantastic and the sashimi was unlike anything I've had before. Everything came out dish by dish and we shared it all family style. I think somewhere around Lamb Dumplings we started to wonder if our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. The fritter were the perfect way to end the parade of food. They tasted like a really sweet funnel cake almost. Definitely more a dessert than a side dish. And maybe you noticed the check in offer? A 2 minute heart to heart with the owner. They aren't kidding. We chatted about the history of the restaurant and the recipes, ourselves and just a lot more. It was very weird and fun and so different than anything else you'd find. I feel like I am saying this a lot but, jeez, it was just so San Francisco. The space is very trendy and fun but has a vibe club to it. I would recommend for a big group dinner with friends over a date or a family dinner.",
            "Korean fusion tapas best enjoyed with can after can of Tecate, because San Francisco! Bulgogi Nachos, Spicy Elote Fritters (more like a sweet corn funnel cake, only a touch denser), Kurobata Bao, Tecate #1, Butterfish Sashimi, Korean Fried Chicken, Chili Green Beans, Tecate #2, Crab Cake Sliders, Honey Aioli Shrimp (their play on Honey Walnut), Tecate #3, Crispy Sprouts, Lamb Dumplings, Sweet Potato Samosas (that tasted like pumpkin pie puff pastry, in an oddly good way), & ... you guessed it, Tecate #4. The food was shared family style (tapas, y'all) between 7 of us, so we doubled down on a couple orders, but we all FEASTED. Then came arguably (cuz the food was pretty dang tasty!) the best part: the Yelp check-in offer, a 2-minute heart to heart with the owner, Patrick, which we all redeemed and combined into a 14-minute hearts to heart that included chatting about the restaurant, the food, our jobs, shots of soju, & lots of randomness. A fun, super friendly food and drink experience from start to finish, and that's what bumps it into that 5-star territory. It's not easy standing out in the SF dining scene (there's a lot of good food out there) but these peeps have found a way to do it. Major props.",
            "On the off chance that you accept only one person on the web today, trust that this spot is staggering! The lager suggestions were exceptional, heaps of neighborhood blends, and the lunch was wonderful. All cooked in an open kitchen. We came into town for work and discovered this spot simply off California Street. Because of the staff!!",
            "I've been wanting to try RM 212 for a while now and finally got the chance to while catching up with a long time friend. We ordered Yogurt Soju to share and got two dishes - Foie Gras Wontons served with Mango Gastrique and fully loaded Bulgogi Nachos. The Yogurt Soju was so tasty and the food was the perfect amount for the two of us. I definitely want to come back to try out some of the other good looking eats on the menu.",
            "It was good not great. I liked it didn't love it. Maybe would not go back though not memorable. Small place. Server was nice.",
            "I highly recommend RM 212 whether you are eating in or taking out. I have been here twice now for to go lunches and I love it. This time I ordered the chicken tikka tacos and a side of tots topped with kimchi and a special sauce and I was very impressed. The tacos were delicious, stuffed with chicken and other fresh toppings. The tots were perfectly deep fried - not too greasy and crunchy on the outside while softer on the inside - and the kimchi on top was surprisingly wonderful. I would have never thought to put kimchi on top of tater tots before and it's genius. The staff here were nice and the service was fast! The inside was clean and well organized, and the signage outside makes it stand out from the other restaurants nearby.When I first saw the meal I was worried it would be too small but it was actually the perfect amount. The portions were great and I definitely would have overeaten had they given me more, especially more tots. I am already planning my next chicken tikka taco with tots lunch...",
            "I tried coming one Tuesday night at 8:30pm and it was a total fail because when we got to the restaurant we were told that all the best/most popular dishes on the menu were sold out...so we decided to go elsewhere. I came back another weekday but this time 7pm and thankfully everything we wanted to eat was available. RM212 is asian tapas so the portion of each item is on the smaller side. Between 3 people we shared 5 dishes: foie gras wontons, string beans (tried to throw in a veggie XD), lamb pot stickers, korean fried chicken, and aioli shrimp. All the dishes were really delicious--we were super impressed! I highly recommend the foie gras wontons and the lamb pot stickers because they were super flavorable and the wontons/pot stickers are crispy on the outside but very juicy on the inside YUM! I would skip on the KFC and the string beans and try something else because they were nothing special. Pro tip: RM212 takes reservations so I highly recommend doing this to avoid unexpected wait times and also this makes for a really good date spot (impress your date with your thoughtful planning :P).",
            "*Allergy friendlyTo be perfectly honest, this restaurant wasn't the best option for someone like me with food allergies, but the chef was very accommodating. I am allergic to soy and have a strong food sensitivity to garlic and onions, which of course makes dining in San Francisco pretty unfortunate with all the delicious Asian cuisine out there. RM 212 restaurant bent over backwards to make it possible for me to try a couple of dishes...the elote corn fritters and the pork belly baos. Though the already-limited tapas menu suddenly became really limited, when I think back to what I enjoyed the most about my food it was the different textures in my mouth. The freshly fried elote corn fritters were rich and packed with ooey gooey goodness (but so rich I had to stop after a couple). I quickly became obsessed with the fluffy, marshmallowy texture of the steamed buns that came with my pork belly. It was like biting into a cloud with a bit of substance. It was also a good thing two pork belly baos arrived on my plate, because the pork belly portion was fairly small (especially since I couldn't eat the onions or anything additional they were served with). I realized when writing this review that I must of have forgotten to check in on Yelp, but that didn't matter. The Yelp check in offer for a lovely two-minute conversation with our server (maybe the owner?) still took place. The restaurant was pretty small, but in a good way. Clean bathrooms, and overall ready to deal with those with food allergies. Oh...and they take reservations! Check, check, check :-)Note: I initially intended to hit the 4-star rating and realized I accidentally gave it 3 stars, so this has been updated to reflect that.",
            "My friend and I read such good reviews about the place so we were excited to try the place out. We walked in on a weekday for dinner. The food is Asian fusion tapas. We tried their baos, foie gras wonton, butterfish and crab sliders. Everything was okay. I like the idea of these dishes, good ingredients, interesting sauce, etc. But in reality, the execution just didn't work for me. The foie gras wonton did not taste like foie gras at all. Crab slider had the tiniest patty of crab meat inside, the asparagus in the butterfish was like a brown yellowish color. We also tried some of their cocktails. The drinks tasted great, but were low in alcohol.  My friend is the most lightweight person I've ever seen, and gets drunk on 1.5 glasses of wine. But somehow after two martinis, she wasn't feeling buzzed at all. For me that's a good thing but I thought it was worth mentioning. While we were eating, there was also a table of 8 people watching the a basketball game in the restaurant, and they were cheering and yelling as if their first born was playing in the game. So the dining experience was not pleasant at all. I could barely hear my own voice when I was trying to talk to my friend. So I'm not sure what exactly they are trying to be here, a sports bar? a restaurant? We ate as fast as we could and left for another restaurant for drinks and desserts. Overall the food is okay, nothing super special. For a city like sf with so many food options, it does not really stand out. And the owner didn't seem to care to create a good dining experience after all.",
            "Oh no no. I remember the moment I saw this place on Yelp on the stairmaster and I regret it. This was such a WASTE of money and time. I will say that the lychee sojutini was actually really good but I doubt there was ANY alcohol in there. I literally couldn't taste any and I was even more sober than I was before when I drank it. The prices here was just beyond ridiculous. We got the bulgogi nachos and a tataki and the size was just not even worth half the price. We had to stop ordering bc we literally couldn't afford it. Afterwards, I still had to go home and make something bc I was still STARVING. Oh nuh uh.. definitely left swipe.",
            "Had lunch here yesterday with a group as they were one of the few spots that were both well reviewed AND took lunch resos (and for anyone who has seen the lunch rush in SFO knows... that's GOLD). RM 212 is a smaller space a short walk from the financial district. They offer mostly tapas (shared) Asian ingredient inspired options that are both delicious sounding and delicious tasting. Two members of our group had dietary restrictions (vegetarian, no garlic, no soy, and preferably no onions) all of which can be tough for a mostly Asian cuisine. This was no problem for them, the went to the chef and figured work arounds for our table that allows everyone to have a full and enjoyable meal. Stand out items for me we're the Pork Belly Bao (2 in a serving), the kimchi tater tots, the corn fritters and the General Chan wings. We ordered most of the menu and all the food was pretty good. Prices also were fair for tapas and if I had to pick on one thing it would have been to have a couple more options on the food menu, but really that's it. Definitely a good option, and I will return for their happy hour drink specials next time I visit SFO. Eatcrest Out.",
            "I don't know if I've ever felt more welcomed into someone's restaurant than I did here. The owner greeted us, seated us, took our orders, accommodated us, and made us feel entirely welcome into his \"home.\"The space is small, but perfect for lunch with a small group of friends (annnnnnd they take reservations!). They were unbelievably kind to us when we admitted that half our party had serious dietary restrictions. If the menu seems a bit concerning, I wouldn't worry - they went above and beyond in making sure that everyone in our party was fed and fed well. Of the things I ate, my two favorite things were:1. KFCauliflower (with maple gochujang glaze) - I guess I missed the punny name, but while eating these I was so impressed with their perfect fried coated exterior and soft \"meaty\" interior. Nice sweet, spicy, and tangy sauce too!2. Kim Chi Tots (with honey avocado aioli) - It's like a variation of poutine; so, if you like tots, kim chi, and a creamy sauce... you will not go wrong with these.We also tried the Elote Corn Fritter (they were more like a gooey donut hole) and Sweet Potato Samosas (such a flaky, mouthwatering pastry!; however, the flavors of the dipping sauce [truffle and cilantro], didn't really come through the way I was hoping). Good, but not as much of a standout as the tots and cauliflower! It's important to note that the portions aren't enormous (as a solo diner who LOVES to eat but HATES to feel weighed down midday from a big meal, I'd say that two things off the menu would be plenty). One suggestion, RM 212? Offer a vegetarian friendly bao!!! I have great faith you'd make an amazing one.P.S.The owner is serious about the two minute heart-to-heart (it's Check In Offer), so have a chitchat and unburden!",
            "We chose based on the reviews but realized we may not have been the most sophisticated when it comes to understanding our options and what we were getting.The Korean Fried Chicken was wings (though the menu didn't specify). I don't eat wings-too messy and lots of work for such little meat-that's just MO. So added an order of the Butterfish-served raw...wasn't expecting that. The Samosas were great as were corn fritters. Add those fried items to the fried wings and it was just too much fried for meBased on the clientele they seemed to know/understand what they were getting so gad we known the menu better we may have ordered differently.its been 7 years since I've been in SF but the Asian Fusion I first had in 1995, then again in 2011 seemed different. I know it morphs with time but it just didn't knock my socks off like I'd hoped."

            "Italian Homemade Company is AMAZING. - EVERYTHING TASTES SO GOOD!! We ordered three pasta dishes to share between the two of us because it was just that good. You can mix and match your pasta + sauces. We got the parpadelle, gnocchi, and tortellini with pasticciata sauce, marinara, and butter and sage. Loved the meatball sauce. The butter and sage is kind of an acquired taste so I would only recommend it if you like sage. I would say, though, that the pasta quality (the texture and chewiness) is the best part of the food. The sauces were ok. - The wait isn't bad even if the line seems long. We went at around 8 PM on a Friday night. The line was long but it moves very quickly because you order at the counter before finding a place to sit. No frills dining.- everyone is so nice! The place definitely had a very family feel. Would definitely go back again!",
            "My husband and I were craving pasta and tried this place out because of the high star ratings. We ordered two pasta dishes to go... fettuccine with white sauce and pappardelle with tomato sauce, and breadsticks on the side... nothing major. When I first walked in, I was expecting to be nicely greeted rather than standing for about 8 minutes just to let them know that I'm picking up my order. No friendly smiles. Just people speaking in their language which is quite rood. I finally paid and was eager to go try the food out. We found a spot nearby and got prepared to eat.As soon as we open the boxes we were shocked! The fettuccine with white sauce barley had any sauce to coat the pasta. My pappardelle was just okay and didn't have any major flavor to make my soul happy. It was just your basic tomato sauce with no taste of basil what so ever. I also asked for extra cheese on the side which I did not receive. The bread sticks were the worst ever! Like no joke. I'm not sure why it's even called bread sticks when it's more like pita chips that have been left out for a few days. Hard, dry, and tasteless. It was surely a waste of my $40 dollars and I will not be returningDo better Italian Homemade Company. Seriously. For everyone out there, don't always trust places with high ratings cause you might just get disappointed like we did!",
            "Uh, fresh made noodles with delicious sauces. This place is amazing. It's what I'd call a hole in the wall. First come, first serve.The meatballs are flavorful, the noodles supple, the lasagna perfectly balanced in texture. Drinks are bottled. When done you bus yourself.Given what it is, how delicious the food is, and how gorgeous the owners daughters are I simply cannot give this any less than 5. I've been to a few fancy Italian places. They drown the food in herbs or over salt. The blending here is superb. The prices are great. The selection fantastic.",
            "I was never a huge fan of pasta....until I tried Italian Homemade Company.While it can get packed here sometimes, the staff are usually pretty friendly/warm and are definitely authentically Italian. They give great recommendations if you're not sure of what to order or how to order. I've tried several of their dishes and desserts both to-go and dine-in and I have never been disappointed. The pastas, the sauces, and the desserts have all been EXCELLENT in taste and texture. I even tried their veggie lasagna, which was a little strange (in terms of what I'm used to) but very tasty. My favorites might be the fettuccine with white sauce, gnocchi with pesto, and their tiramisu (interestingly light with a great cocoa flavor). Their pannacotta is also pretty good and I'm usually not a fan of pannacotta.In my opinion though, just try everything and figure out which flavors and textures you like. Keep an eye on their specials menu as well, since it changes and always looks good (I have yet to try).I will DEFINITELY be back. The hard part is stopping myself from going too often!",
            "Omg omg omg. This place is so delicious. I literally licked my plate clean before throwing it away. I almost didn't tell you that part but I have no shame and it's crucial you understand how good this food really was. I ordered the Gnocchi pesto. I had extremely high expectations from the photos, the reputation from my friends, the smell inside and honestly, this place exceeded it in every way. I kinda had an inkling I'd fall drooling in love with their pasta when the woman taking my order had an Italian accent. I mean come on!?I think this place really shines when you go with 1 or 2 other people. That way you can do Tapas style and share the different sauces. The portion size is perfect for 1 person so for those who want to explore via their tastebuds it doesn't make sense to order multiple if you're going solo. Hence bring your friends.Definitely try this place out!!!",
            "Pasta was pretty good--there are of course, some clumps of it that stick together, but that's to be expected with homemade. I tried their parpadelle with the pastaciatta sauce, it wasn't my favorite but overall had a good flavor. I think next time I'll stick with pure meat sauce or pure white sauce. My dining buddy got their version of fettuccine Alfredo, which she enjoyed, but I found to be overwhelmingly nutmeg-flavored. My other friend got their tortellini with meatballs, which he enjoyed. My main qualm is just the price. $13 for a plate of pasta is really pushing it.",
            "Very authentic homemade pasta!  We had the gnocchi (potato) with marinara and pesto fettuccine.  The place is very small and you order and pay and after you look for your table.  It was very crowded at 7 on a Thursday evening we luckily got a table but a lot of people had to take theirs to go because there were no places to sit.  You can get any homemade pasta paired with any of the sauces.  Your food comes out on paper plates with regular utensils.",
            "Holy moly!!!!  Our whole family loved this place to kick off our food tour of San Francisco.  We have been deprived of fresh pasta for our whole lives and now we are hooked. Perfect flavors and huge portions.  Caprese salad was beautiful and fresh with really nice olive oil.  My daughter declared her meatballs the best she's ever eaten.",
            "There's just something so irresistible to me, about homemade pasta. There's also something so fascinating about watching pasta being hand made. And if you can relate to both of these statements, you should check out Italian Homemade Company, which is exactly what I did on my recent trip to San Francisco. I sought out pasta on purpose knowing somewhere in the city would have what this wandering Walk in and immediately I noticed the fresh pasta being made in the back to the right of the building while to the left is the sauce station, and probably where they boil the pasta.Speaking of pasta, assuming that's what you're here for, it's the first thing you choose, and the options to choose from are:FettucciniTagliatellePappardelleGnocchiVegetarian Ravioli: Ricotta cheese and spinach fillingMeat Ravioli: Beef and Ricotta cheese fillingTortellini: Pork Loin, Prosciutto, Mortadella, Parmigiano filling And a Pasta Special which is an ask the chef kinda deal. Next you choose the sauce. And with plenty to choose from, everything from Bolognese to browned butter and sage, the sauces didn't disappoint.Seeing as how they were out of gnocchi when I got to the front counter (insert 'why does this always happen to me' whiny voice here) I decided to order Pappardelle with Pesto, because you just can't go wrong with a nicely made, big fat pasta covered in pesto. Cooked perfectly, the pasta had an Al dente bite, and the pesto was garlicky and herbaceous. This plate of pasta was magnificent to be honest. Huge hand made pasta noodles with pesto smothering the whole plate! If I could have, I would have ordered a few more kinds to try! If only I had a few more stomachs!!",
            "Went to \"Little Italy\" with some friends in SF the other day & man oh man, this has got to be the best pasta we've ever had! With over 1000 reviews on yelp & still maintaining a 4.5 star rating how could you go wrong?! I dont think I've ever had homemade pasta before- it's way thinner than store bought, food comes out really fast regardless if its busy & it's probably because the pasta is so fresh. The proportion size was literally perfect as well (jun & I are notorious for over ordering & this was one of the rare times we both licked our plates clean.) Highly recommend if you guys are on the embarcadero side of the city! (Also if they have the wild boar on their specials you gotta get it!)",
            "3.5/5Next to sushi and cheese my next top food category is between bread or noodles (especially handmade ones) so I was so excited to give this place a try. Came on a Saturday around noon and got super lucky and snagged a street metered spot right outside. The wait wasn't too bad though fighting for a table wasn't fun.For my meal I had the following:1) Burrata Salad: A sizeable clump of burrata over arugula, a generous handful of cherry tomatoes, w/ balsamic on top for $13. Pretty worth it. Not the best burrata I've had but decent. Some fresh milk taste came through and it was pretty creamy. (3.75/5)2) Tagliatelle w/ bolognese: Wish portions were a bit larger for $12. I love fresh noodles though I wish these ones had a bit more bite to them. The sauce was rather bland and the meat could've been more flavorful. In general could've used more sauce.  (3.25/5)Overall, Italian Homemade Company does have some fresh ingredients but dishes lacked flavor. I'd consider coming back if it wasn't too much of a hassle.",
            "This place was slammed when we drove by, after doing the touristy Lombard Street pics. You've GOTTA do it if you're in San Francisco! Anyways, we assumed after seeing the long line out the door and the 4.5 stars that this place must be 'it' to keep it PG!I called it in because I did NOT want to wait in line! We ordered a fettuccini type dish (white sauce on noodles), a spaghetti with meatballs and sausage, lasagna, and their 'bread'. The fettuccine was dry and terrible tasting. The lasagna was dry too. Even after pouring the extra sauce on top. The bread was so strange for an Italian restaurant. It was like a mix between pita and tortillas. Not at all fitting or good tasting. But the spaghetti was good. That was the only thing that was good. It was very good. Wish we would've ordered only spaghetti. They'd get higher stars, but the review wouldn't be as accurate overall. We may be back, but only for the spaghetti next time!",
            "I ordered the papperdelle with bolognese sauce and meatballs. The real winner here is the meatballs, so I would highly recommend you order that. Meatball was packed with flavor and huge and they gave two with the pasta. The bolognese sauce in itself was lacking some flavor/spices. But the pasta was fresh and I love how thin the pasta was so the ratio to sauce was perfect.",
            "My favorite pasta shop in North Beach! The Gnocchi Pasta with Pesto Sauce is to die for and is always my go-to dish! Italian Homemade is always the first restaurant that pops up in my mind when I'm craving pasta and carbs. This place is a staple in North Beach and the food really lives up to expectations. It can get crowded here during peak hours and the restaurant doesn't have a lot of seating inside either. Tip - call in advance so you pick up your order, instead of having to wait in the long line! There is also a park nearby, which is a great place to enjoy the SF views while eating your food.Other noteworthy items to try here are the Meatballs and Bolognese with Papperdelle. So good and comforting!",
            "Returned to this place after numerous letdown from highly rated places.  Basic meal but very tasty and super friendly staff.  Worth a trip.",
            "This is the perfect example of a \"mom-and-pop\" establishment in SF's Little Italy neighborhood that stays true to their roots. It's a tiny eatery with just a few tables and seating along the window facing the main street. As it approached the dinnertime rush, the line of customers extended out the door and many locals stopped in to pick up takeout orders. Their menu is straightforward with no frills and you receive exactly what you would expect. Don't forget to glance at the board on the back wall that lists a couple of the day's specials. Once we ordered, we snagged a table that had a direct view behind the counter. Two cooks were solely focused on pasta and sandwiches, one employee remained at the cash register and one waiter served all the food. Considering the rush of customers constantly in and out, the staff is pretty efficient at preparing orders in a timely manner. For the pasta dishes, they just heat up the sauce, toss in the pasta until it's completely heated, serve on a simple paper plate and top with Parmesan (if you wish). Then it's good to go!  On the traditional menu, I ordered their House Special Lasagna ($13) and it was humongous!  The layers of pasta were al dente and I enjoyed the hearty bolognese sauce. I was surprised that it didn't seem to have any distinct layers of ricotta cheese, but it must have been mixed in. Nevertheless, the lasagna was delicious and not overly heavy. It tasted very fresh and authentic as if they've been following the same family recipe for years (which very well could be the case)! Two others in my group had pasta dishes (tagliatelle and ravioli) with bolognese as well, which they both enjoyed. Both appeared so fresh and portion sizes in general here are huge.  One item that turned out to be a miss was the sausage and pepper flatbread sandwich as the sausage tasted under-seasoned  My advice is to order a pasta dish since that is their main specialty. I'd recommend Italian Homemade if looking for a quick and affordable spot to fulfill your pasta cravings!",
            "This place is amazing ! Located in the North Beach area. We came here on a Friday night and we actually ordered and sat down before it got crowded.Parking might suck but sometimes you do get lucky if you try to park around the area.For 2, we ordered the fettuccine, lasagna, and ravioli. BOMBBBBB dot com!! Everything tasted so good like Italian food is suppose to. They have a pretty open kitchen so you can see them make most of their foods. They do offer pasta and sauce and stuff to go in case you want to make it yourself at home. It's a small place though so be prepared to wait for someone to be done with their food if this place is packed . Definitely recommended!",
            "My friend and I were looking to try all of the amazing foods of San Francisco and so many people recommended this place. Was really disappointed by the result. The noodles were too hard and overall the taste of the pastas just kinda sucked. I got the white sauce and it literally had no flavor and just tasted like straight nutmeg, it really be tasting like a snickerdoodle and I wanted pasta not a freaking cookie. My friend got some other red sauce with beef (I forgot the name of the sauce because this whole experience made me angry because I love food) and again the noodles were hard as frick but like the sauce was like okay so that is the only reason this place is not getting a straight 1 star. Do not recommend, even cheesecake factory has better pasta.",
            "This place was hidden away in a relatively busy San Francisco street in an unassuming grocery store looking front. You order at the front at a cashier and then wait for around 10-20 minutes for your food which is served to you on a paper plate. It's not super clear how good the food is and how fresh it is until you take your first bite.Food: I got the tagliatelle with meatballs and man it was super tasty  and super rich! I did find some plastic in the food which was a bit of a turn off but the food overall was great. We also got the Burrata cheese salad and it was really really tasty.Service: the food comes out fast and comes out fresh and you can see the food being prepared for you right in front of you! You don't get too much seating either and it's hard to find a spot.Overall, would come again! The food is super good and it's a good deal!",
            "Pasta is delicious, including the gluten free fucilli.  Very quick,  inexpensive meal.  Large portions are perfect for sharing.  Definitely worth stopping in!"

            "So, so good! The wait was quick - about 20 - 30 min for 2 people. We went right at 3 pm. Anyway - ordered the crawfish beignets, chicken and sausage gumbo and fried chicken basket. The crawfish beignets are a must, they are fresh and cheesy inside with just the amount of seasoning and crawfish. The gumbo tasted just like we were in New Orleans but they were missing Tabasco sauce so we had to settle for the alternative which was just a Louisiana hot sauce. The chicken was alright - it didn't have much flavor and I am not really a fan of white meat. But it included a biscuit with some type of jelly which is to die for and the cole slaw was fresh and flavorful! Service was quick and attentive! Must check it out.",
            "First and foremost, expect to wait.The inside is small and quite... personal with other tables. We were called and then they sat another party that was after us at our table.The food was good, although I remembered it being better. I ordered the Crispy Pork Belly and it was good. I recall getting two thinner sliced pieces of pork on my last visit. The one slice I received this go-around was huge and difficult to eat. It wasn't sliced up, just a big block of pork belly. I also ordered grandma's molasses walnut coffee which I thought was different.The experience I had this trip was definitely more on the mediocre side. Would I come back if I were ever in SF again? Possibly, but I also would rather spend my time doing things I love instead standing in line for two hours smelling the wonderful aroma of urine and shit. To each their own though.If you're looking for a trendy, always busy restaurant--this is it! I love the mirror wall.",
            "Good, but I thought it was overrated, I was torn between 3 to 4 star.  I would never wait in line to eat here or most places for that matter like a lot of people seem to do.  I think that might just be the herd mentality/Jones effect when people wait an hour or so for a brunch place, I'd get too hangry for that! lolI really liked my Tofu hash and the portion was huge and shareable.  The beignets were ok but not something I would other again.  I prefer healthy options, but thought I'd try just because.The coffee was nothing to rave about which I think in a city like SF they should have good local coffee especially in boutique restaurants.  I tried my friends sweet ice tea and that was really tasty.  My friends seemed to enjoy their meals, and we shared the shrimp n grits.  I don't eat meat, but they ordered fried chicken.Cute little casual brunch spot with cozy New Orleans theme.  They sell jam and some other items which my friends bought to take back home.",
            "Brenda's got soul.We ordered the beignets sampler, shrimp and grits, and a custom sausage and cheese omelette. Total was ~$70 including tip.I see a lot of comments about wait, we were seated immediately on a friday morning ~9-10 am, the crowd came shortly after though. I've never had a beignet prior to brenda's so we ordered the sampler. Their great! Of the set, the apple turned out the best, if i visited again i would order just a set of those. I tried my wifes shrimp and grits, two things i do not like, it tasted great! nice and spicy but at the same time smooth. my biscuit was, a biscuit. I hate potatoes in any form that isnt mashed or french fries but the potatoes that they served alongside my omelette were great their flavor was complex and you can tell some care went into making them worth something than \"potatoes as a side\". My omelette was good, the sausage tasted great and brenda's was so close to 5 stars... but.... the cheese inside wasn't melted, almost cold in fact. Still edible but Im a little bummed about not being able to give 5 stars for an overall stellar meal.I would return to brenda's if i were a SF native, maybe to try some of that fried chicken we learned was really good only after leaving the restaurant.",
            "Brenda's French Soul Food has been a fixture in the San Francisco food scene for many years. With over 10,000 reviews, it's hard not to be on the forefront of every foodie's list. Housed in a modern-chic environment with lines out the door on a regular basis. This restaurant has drawn the famous Kendrick Lamar and his group to dine here ahead of their Oakland show. As the name suggested, the menu offers Southern comfort food with a French flair in a contemporary forward concept. Crispy fried chicken and grits remain staples here but, the star are their beignets- -this New Orleans special is a must when dining at Brenda's. I opted for their sampler- -Flight of Beignets which featured all four flavors and are served piping hot. By far, the crawfish beignet is my favorite. The crawfish was smothered in cheese and coated in Cajun spices inside of a fluffy pastry for a delicious taste overload. While the sweet beignets were pleasant, it wasn't as impressive as the savory one. I also ordered their chicken and andouille sausage Jambalaya served with a mixed green salad. The texture of the rice was perfect. Unfortunately, the flavors were a bit muted. It lacked the bold flavors that a Cajun dish is known for. Otherwise, it was decent. Service was a disappointment. I understand the place is busy but, as a first time customer who's trying to manuever through their menu it would have been nice for a little patience from my server. I felt rushed while putting in my order. With so many other stellar options on their menu, I am excited to return and try them out!",
            "Taste: 5Value: 4The food here is incredible! We ordered the mother-in-law (a po-boy sandwich variant), crawfish beignets, catfish benedict, and sausage omelette. The grits here are so good! They are part polenta and possibly part cheese, and the combination of it all is so creamy and tasty!  All the food here was full of flavor, hot, and crispy when it was supposed to be. Interestingly, I found the po-boy sandwich, while good, to be the least impressive part of our meal. It was lacking in the amount of crispy shrimp (which were small) and the other condiments were plain lettuce and tomato. We loved everything here!",
            "I was so excited to try this place since they have so many Yelp reviews! My friend and I came here on a Friday afternoon around 12:30pm which is lunch time. There were people waiting outside so we knew we would have to wait. We placed our name on the waiting list, there were about 6 people in front of us which was not too bad. About 10 minutes later, the hostess asked us if we want to sit at the counter because they have two spots open, so of course we did not pass this up. Now on to the food!We ordered a strawberry mimosa, guava mimosa, the Chicken Étouffée, Beignet Flight, two BFC chicken wings, and a side of french fries. The mimosas were really good! You could definitely taste the champagne but they were very good! The strawberry and guava added the sweetness to the champagne.The Chicken Étouffée was amazing! It was rich and creamy but soo flavorful. If you are not too hungry and want something small, this is the item for you! This reminded me of chicken enchilada soup, but better!I didn't think that I would be able to finish the BFC, so I ordered the side of wings instead and wow were these great! The chicken was fried to perfection, it was crispy, and spicy. The chicken was juicy and came right off of the bone. It came with cocktail sauce so you are getting both spicy and sweet flavors. The french fries were great! They had a cajun-like seasoning and went perfect with the BFC wings.The beignet flight is a must get! I didn't try the crawfish one which my friend absolutely loved. However, I did try the plain, nutella, and apple ones and these were great! They are doughy and hot and will melt right in your mouth! This is very filling and a pretty large dish but so worth it.The service was great. Our server was super sweet and very attentive. This place did not disappoint and definitely lived up to my expectations of soul food! I would come back on another weekday!",
            "Brenda's was on my SF bucketlist foreeeeeever.  I mean, just look at all the amazing reviews and there's no place like it back where I'm from in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Thankfully, I finally got a taste a little over a year ago when a friend & I randomly decided to meet up and paid this fine establishment a visit for dinner.  I know, I'm late on my review game... but alas, here I am.I was staying near Union Square and this restaurant is in the Tenderloin district. *gasp* I know, the area tends to have a bad rap. No worries, just bring a friend and you'll be fine.  Us 2 little Asians managed the walk round trip unscathed.  Sure, it's a bit more rough, but you mind your own and everyone else minds their own.  Besides, there is promise of good food for those who make venture out to this little restaurant!It took us maybe 20 minutes to walk over and as expected, the restaurant was filled from wall to wall with hungry patrons.  We put our names down on the chalkboard and waited our turn which wasn't too long at all.  We finally got our table and it was a real tight fit (hence the 4 stars).  Plan to get warm & cozy with your neighbors.  It's a small and incredibly popular spot.I originally wanted to get the beignet flight so I could get a little taste of everything, but found out that's only served during brunch.  Shucks.  I settled on the Shrimp & Grits & my friend got the BFC. I couldn't leave without trying a beignet, so we got the crawfish beignets to share.  Mmmm, sauteed shrimp, cheddar grits, in a spicy tomato-bacon gravy.  The shrimp and grits were tasty and was such a generous portion.  The amount of cheese was just right & the shrimp were cooked perfectly.  The beignets were also much bigger than I had anticipated.  The outside was crisp yet soft and the filling was warm and creamy.  So good!  Wish I could have tried other flavors, but I was happy I could at least try one.  I was so stuffed by the end of the evening.What a great place for some real soul food.  Hope to be back sometime to try their brunch one day since that seems to be what they're known for!",
            "Wow!!! This place is a must try if you're in the city looking for amazingly cooked soul food!When you first come, make sure you write your name & how many people are in your party on the chalk board inside! Then you hangout in line & patiently wait for the host to call your name. I went on a Sunday morning around 10:30am, there was a line but my party only waited about 30 minutes.I ordered the fried chicken benedict with a side of hash. First of all...it was life changing! I've never had fried chicken in a form of a benedict before. I was expecting it to taste a bit too much and heavy...I was wrong! The chicken was bursting with flavor and the biscuit that the chicken was on was oddly very delicious and flavorful! My group also ordered the flight of beignets! My favorite was the crawfish beignet, it had a kick to it and again so much flavor as well- a must try here. I tried the chocolate beignet and it was a bit too chocolate-y for my taste. If you're a chocolate fein then you'd love it. The apple beignet was really good! It contained little bits of apple, it reminded me of a warm apple pie. The plain beignet was fluffy & sweet.This restaurant is the closest thing to authentic southern food, right here in the Bay Area. Can't wait to try everything on the menu.",
            "Very tasty fried chicken!! We came here on a Monday with no wait. The biscuits are very tasty as is the fried chicken. It has a slight kick to it that really adds great flavor. The beignets are also very tasty and bring you back to New Orleans! Everything is fried to perfection and not overly greasy. The chicken itself was super juicy and perfectly crunchy on the outside. It was a great piece of white meat and had a lot of flavor without the fat. The coleslaw was a great side addition and wasn't too salty or have too much of a thick fatty dressing. Their jelly is also reaaaaaaly good and I would recommend this place for sure. I didn't have the French toast, but wow- it looked amazing!!",
            "Walked here from Union Square, arrived around 6:30p on a busy Saturday night wrote our name on the giant chalkboard waiting list. Was told the wait would be 20-25mns long. Boy were we wrong we were sat at 7:20p. Once we were sat the table had fried blackeyed peas and water. We ordered crawfish beignet , fries oyster poboy, and jambalaya. The beignet were huge fried to perfect warm and gooey and delicious on the inside. Fried oysters were having a party in my mouth. So tasty and ooey the creamy horseradish gave it a nice kick. Jambalaya served seemed sad and unappealing but once I tasted it it was delicious as well ! You can't go wrong ordering something on the menu. Street parking is difficult to find, be prepared to wait long but it's well worth it. All the servers and staff were extremely friendly and jolly. We even spilled a full cup of water were deeply apologetic and the staff wasn't even phased. They said \"you're not family until you spill something\" Overall 10/10 would recommend, would return on visits",
            "I came here years ago and was absolutely in love with the Crawfish Beignets here, so Brenda's was my first stop during my recent trip to SF. I came by on a weekday and the wait was around 90 minutes. Luckily, I was by myself and snagged the last seat at the counter bar. I ordered 2 Crawfish Beignets, and they arrived quickly! While they weren't as amazing as I remembered, they were still very delicious! I loved the cheesy crawfish filling inside! They would've been better if they had a little more filling, because there was definitely a lot of dough. Though the beignets may not seem too large, they're pretty filling!I would definitely want to come back and try some of the other brunch specialties!",
            "This place was awesome! It has a lovey city vibe, seemingly small on the outside but huge on the inside. Food came out super fast and we had a party of 8, so I was very impressed. Food: (8/10) The biscuit was perfectly flakey yet consistent, and had an amazing chew to it, and the hash potatoes were well cooked and seasoned. However the omelette, while filled with great veggies, was unseasoned and not super flavorful (tasted best with hot sauce). I also got the Guava mimosa, which tasted super yummy, but try adding a bit of OJ and it will taste better Location: (8/10) It's not too hard to find parking within a few blocks of this place, and I even came on a Saturday! But there's barely anything right outside of the restaurant - typical for SFVibe: (10/10) LOVE the inside of this place, the mirrors make it very edgyOther: it was frustrating that we could not get seating before our whole party arrived, because it meant waiting even longer for a spot once everyone arrived. The waitresses there were all very nice and did a great job balancing the tables.",
            "Does Brenda's need more reviews? Probably not. Will I still review it? Absolutely! What's French soul food, you ask? Well, all I know is that I like French, I like cajun/creole, and I like soul food. So there you go. I still remember trying out this place for lunch on my very first day at work simply because my job is in the TL and Brenda's is the most reviewed restaurant in my hood. So I had to come check it out! Since then, I've dined here quite a few times. I do have to warn you that there is always a line. But there are also counter seats near the entrance if you don't have the time and patience to wait for a table.I like the ambiance, it is quite nostalgic. Their gumbo is excellent! It is so rich and full of flavors. They don't skimp on the ingredients. Chicken, sausage, and okra, oh my! The crawfish beignet is a must. Or better yet, get a beignet flight so you can try them all. I've had beignet in New Orleans before but they were sweet. Savory beignet is deff new to me. And it's so good! I've also tried the infamous BFC and shrimp and grits. Both were decent but my favorites were still their gumbo and beignet. Although I have to say I've had better cajun food in New Orleans, I still enjoy coming to Brenda's and bringing out of guests here.",
            "The shrimp and grits are my fave! I tried the pork belly and grits, which had a spicier sauce, but the shrimp is better. The dish has big shrimp, cheesy grits and a smoky flavor with a little bit of a kick. It's pretty filling and warms your soul.The beignets are delicious. My ranking: chocolate and crawfish are tied for first, plain and then apple.The collard greens are good too. Not overly salty. I thought the biscuit was a bit dry, but nothing the jam couldn't fix.It's a very chill atmosphere. There was a band playing which added to the NOLA vibe. I was with a group of 6, Super Bowl Sunday. We got there around 7:20. I really appreciate that we weren't rushed through our meal even though we came pretty close to closing.",
            "We came here on a Sunday afternoon at 12:30pm for brunch, it was close to a 1.5 hour wait. I can definitely say it was worth the wait.We ordered1. Beignet flight: chocolate, apple, crawfish, and plain - the dough itself was so soft, warm, and melt in your mouth delicious. My favorite was the crawfish or chocolate, one being very savory and so good and the other being satisfying for dessert. It's quite filling and big and could be a dish in itself2. Fried chicken eggs Benedict: so good and really satisfies your cravings for lunch and breakfast with the fried chicken and eggs, a great savory kick to it3. Crispy pork belly - the pork belly is very tender and chewy, not so crispy, but still very delicious. I wasn't too big of a fan of the cheddar grits though but the pork belly itself was tastyOverall amazing food and a great New Orleans touch brought to SF. It was plentiful portions where we were able to have it for dinner. Service was overall good and quick. You can walk around and explore the neighborhood while waiting for a table.",
            "This place is amazing! We lucked out and found street parking right across the street. There were like 4 meter spots available. We waited 25 mins for a table of 2 on a Friday at 1130am. Go inside and put your name on the chalkboard. Our waiter was very friendly. Didn't catch his name but he was a shorter gentleman. We ordered the beignet flight. Apple, Plain, chocolate and crawfish. In order of my preference. I wasn't really a fan of the crawfish even though there are tons of positive reviews for it. Just not my cup of tea. But to be fair, a good amount of crawfish in the beignet. We ordered a side of chicken etouffee. It reminded me of gumbo but it wasn't! Don't confuse it with the gumbo! The chicken etouffee was quite delicious and came with rice. Very flavorful and great consistency.I got the spicy pasta Orleans. This was sooo good! There was a generous amount of sauce and was not too spicy. Gave it a great kick. It came with mussels, andouille sausage, shrimp and crawfish. Again, generous amount of seafood. Probably my favorite pasta dish ever!Hubby got the fried chicken (BFC). Can't go wrong with fried chicken so his was pretty good as well.",
            "This is one of the best best, if not, best brunch I've had in SF. the portions are huge, and ambience is lively without being overbearing, and the food is amazing. The Cajun flavors in all the dishes was absolutely perfect (and that's coming from someone who spent a decade near Cajun/Creole food nearby). The beignet flight includes a classic, Granny Smith Apple, Chocolate, and Crawfish beignet. Overall, their beignets are not as soft/fluffy as the ones you get at Cafe Du Monde or even Disneyland, but are still packed with flavor and very rich-so they're more filling than you would assume. The Granny Smith beignet has a scrumptious apple pie fill and was probably my favorite in the sweets. The chocolate beignet was great and rich as well, but I think I was really partial to the Granny Smith. Crawfish beignet is extremely rich but was probably my favorite as the filling is perfectly packed with crawfish and loaded with melted, stringy cheese. The peach cobbler pancakes are to die for as well and pack a perfect peach punch. The chicken Etouffeé had perfect spice, creaminess, and balance overall. We were lucky to have no wait on a Wednesday 11am, but immediately after we were seated, the line was building up and out the door before noon again.",
            "TL;DR: scrumptious southern food, but only worth it if you are coming on a weekdayI'd been getting mixed reviews about Brenda's, but had to try their famous brunch after 4 years of living in the Bay. Aware of their long waits, we came around 9 am on a Wednesday and were pleased to see an almost empty restaurant.Food 4/5: we shared an assortment of beigents, and I got myself a fried chicken Benedict- Beignets: I loved the plain and the apple ones! The texture was so warm and soft - what a perfect southern dish. The crawfish one looked interesting, but I was waaaaaay too full to try it.- Fried chicken Benedict with grits: tbh I didn't know what grits was before ordering it and was surprised to get a soup-like cheesy side dish. It was a good addition to the eggs, but again I couldn't get through even half of it! The actual Benedict was quite tasty but far from the best one I've had (ex: Angeline's in Berkeley).Ambiance 4/5: the restaurant is cute, but I wish tables were a little bigger. I kept knocking over my things, and there was barely any space for a shared plate for the bignets.",
            "Meh this place wasn't as bomb as I remembered.. I'd only come back for the PLAIN BEIGNET & a jar of the STRAWBERRY PRESERVES. THE FLIGHT OF BEIGNETS:  are really the best thing and maybe the only thing I would come back for (they do take out!). Now I have had my share of beignets.. The crab was good for savory. Chocolate almost overwhelmed it. Apple was good, but nothing to write home about. Honestly **THE PLAIN BEIGNET is my favorite. Its classic. You get the fluffy light crunch of a beignet (they do it very well here, might I add!) with the light sweetness of the dough combined with the powder sugar topping. The plain beigniet with some coffee is what I know I will think about and crave from this place. Comes hot and pretty soon after you order it, so don't put your order in until you are ready to eat itWATERMELON ICED TEA: it wasn't as good as i remembered. I like unsweetened ice tea so it was too sweet for me. If you like sweet tea, you will love this.SHRIMP & GRITS: i love me some shrimp and grits.. this was ok. It was almost too rich and oily with the cheese ans bacon. The tails on the shrimp were left on so it was slightly awkward to eat.BISCUIT: I have had better biscuits. Not as fluffy and buttery as I like. It almost fell apart because it was so dry. It almost felt like a scone more than a biscuit.. maybe that's why the delicious strawberry preserves go so well with it! **STRAWBERRY PRESERVES: This came with the biscuit but deserves recognition of its own. My second favorite thing here outside of the beignet! Chunks of fresh strawberry make this jam shine. I'd but the bottle of it they sell if it wasn't $10 and likely full of way too much sugar that I probably don't need to be eating on a regular basis ha. I'd considerate it though! This would go great with scones and some clotted cream. GRAVY: Got this to try with the biscuits but it was meh. The strawberry preserves go way better with the biscuit.AMBIANCE: your typical cafe with uncomfortable chairs and stools. Pretty small like a lot of SF places.WAIT: came here around 3pm on a Sunday and still ended up waiting an hour for 2 people! SERVICE: the single hostess in charge of their manual chalk board waitlist was also in charge of takeout orders (putting them in and getting them). Quite hectic.. server was nice though."

            "Blue angel watching..... Now we hungry. Was in north beach to have a quick potty break and where we parked was damn near a few doors down from bodega. The aroma was delightful. Looked at the menu. Its a wine and beer bar with bites.  Sat at the counter/ bar. Ordered a glass of Rose, reasonably priced at $13 and was a hefty pour. Next glass,  the last of the malbec. It's sold out..as of this second lolNow for the bites. The garlic bread with added slice tomato on the side and the brussel sprouts were our choices. The brussel sprouts alone make this place 5 stars.  Please try these sprouts. I beg of you",
            "Food: Brussels sprouts were amazing, the mushroom toast was delicious. Mac and cheese wasn't as flavorful.Nice ambiance and friendly service",
            "So here I am freshly landed in San Francisco, in a city I have yet to discover, completely jet lagged from the east coast/west coast flight. And I'm hungry. I did not feel like eating in a crappy fast food in a place with bright fluorescent lights. Nor did I want, as I was by myself, to eat in a restaurant that was too formal.Yelp to the rescue! A quick search on what was close to the hotel, and I found this little gem. Just what I needed!First, the vibe. I loved (LOVED!) the dark-ish ligthing, mostly coming from the red neon sigh. Beautiful place, designed yet casual, warm, inviting. Being alone, I sat at the bar.I ordered the gruyere grilled cheese with bone marrow onions, and the sauteed brussels sprouts with jalapeños. Absolutely decadent, delicious, comforting. Yep, just what I needed. Oh, is that craft beer you have on tap? Oh yes, I'd like one please! Faction Brewing from Alameda, kudos for this WES KAAP IPA, an excellent IPA hopped with african hops.Sated, fully satisfied of this evening, I walked back to the hotel, ready for a good night sleep, excited for the day to come.",
            "This cute little wine bar doesn't have happy hour. Minus one star because it lacks the happiest of hours.It's also known as the place with the big red lips outside. You can't miss it on the corner. It's plump and juicy and tantalizing you to come inside. Temptress move!I've been here a year prior and tried their sangria. It was a weak sangria to be honest. I've had better. Significantly better. This sangria was watered down and barely had any essence of booze or fruit.Came here a second time to try the sweet potato tacos because my friend was totally raving about them. They're $10 for two tacos and they definitely load the tortilla vehicle with a mountain high of sweet potatoes and goat cheese with some sort of sauce? The tacos were tasty and soft for the palate. I still prefer dirty mexican tacos but these will do the trick when I try to be all dainty with my wine. it's a cute date night spot and perfect for people watching if you sit by the window. It's rather small inside which I prefer because the setting is intimate so don't come her expecting a rager folks.",
            "Have seen several rotations of the wine list now and every time I've enjoyed the staffs picks. The short rib tacos  should be on your list if you like more filling bar bites. Windows and music are the neighborhoods best.",
            "Looking for a good wine bar or date spot in North Beach, this is your place. Super cute location, and convenient to Washington Square Park. Service is great, and wine, and beer selection is also on point. Really have no complaints and have come back a few times. Solid date night spot if you are looking for somewhere to grab drinks in North Beach!",
            "Bodega is a cute wine bar! Great date spot or just dinner with friends. Love the environment and the selections of wine are pretty great and perfect cellar temperature. The service is great and the food is AMAZING!! I pretty much ordered different items on the menu and it was not a disappointment. Things I ordered:- Garlic Bread: firebrand sourdough ,  parsley, pecorino- Brussels Sprouts: jalapeño, cilantro, feta - Beef Short Rib Tacos: manzanita braised short rib, pico- Carnitas Tacos: pork shoulder, onion, cilantro- Bodega Dawg: In house­made sausage, watercress, brioche",
            "I'm a little reluctant to write this review because I don't want everyone to find out how amazing Bodega is. I came here on a whim with a group of friends and we were all so happy with our experience! The food and wine was incredible but the service was even better. Our waiter was the best! He gave us excellent recommendations along with generous glasses of wine. He even brought us samples before we committed to a glass. We truly appreciated the excellent service! In terms of food, our group shared a variety of small plates of brussels sprouts, charcuterie, and garlic bread. We loved it all and would return in a heartbeat!",
            "I found my new favorite spot in the city! Eric was seriously amazing and so sweet, he let us taste a couple wines before we chose which one we wanted and was the example of a true hospitality connoisseur. We got the avo toast, trout toast and the blt (they put the bacon on the side since I don't eat meat) and we're beyond accommodating. Everything was perfect and the inside decor was really well put together. Very modern!We went on Saturday morning where they have their brunch menu until 3pm. The only thing I'd recommend is starting their lunch menu at 1. :) Thanks Bodega, we loved you!",
            "Love this spot! Attended a friend's birthday party here one Saturday afternoon, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The ambiance is fun, fresh, and delightfully rustic (the most rustic part being an outhouse-inspired bathroom out back!) Had to dock a star because service was dreadfully slow. We would order things at the bar and wait approximately 20-30 minutes for them to show up. It also took a little cajoling from the staff to get. Despite the wait for food, we had a great time and when the food did show up it was very tasty. Bodega is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood and I hope to see them there for many years to come.",
            "Nice little wine bar on a corner in North Beach, perfect for date nights!I'd always pass by and admire the nice glasses they serve wine in and decided to try out for myself the other day. I enjoyed a nice Cab Sav in a giant awesome wine glass. All of the tables are communal which is cool - maybe not the best idea to take a first date. Service is great and the ambiance is top notch.Love it!",
            "Not a bad little spot.  I made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine without tasting first... don't recommend it, even if the wine is from Argentina.  Go ahead, try it first (because they will offer).The lamb meatballs are really good,  the heirloom tomato panzanella was pretty incredible!  Go, try, enjoy!",
            "Amazing spot for a date or groups or a solo mish!!! Every single item on the menu is amazing-- nothing disappoints!! Vegetarian and omnivore friendly. They are great with wine recommendations. The whole staff is basically the shi",

            "Finally a REALLY great wine bar in North Beach!!!A simple, but warm, dark wood & white motif.  Beautiful counter seating.  All windows, so lovely sunlight & prime people watching on the corner of Columbus & Filbert.  And they've definitely taken wine nibbles up a notch.  Short rib tacos, avocado toast w a fried egg, Molinari charcuterie plate.  Yes, please.Service is pretty rock star, but thankfully not quite hipster.  Relief.  And seriously zero attitude.  I felt like I was already back in the hood as a resident (happening soon) because that's how they treated me.  Love.Bring your pooch.  Every time I've come by, there's at least one adorable canine chilling w the parents!  Is it a beautiful sunny day?  Then it really goes w the territory; fuggetaboutit!  Sip a glass of vino, nosh on a cheese plate, & then take Fido to the park.  Washington Square Park is right across the street.  Life is good.  Good price point.  Cozy atmosphere.  Great spot.4 & 1/2 stars.",
            "This is SUCH a cute and hip spot. Great wine selection, tasty little dishes, and incredible service. Try the Brussels sprouts and ask the staff for wine recommendations. I wish I had more photos because the atmosphere is charming. We'll be back soon!",
            "A lovely little wine bar on Columbus. Their wine selection and bar snacks was suitable for the size, but left a bit to be desired. I was somewhat disappointed by the knowledge of the staff regarding their wines. Out of the three wines we had, only the Cab met expectations. The atmosphere makes up for it though, and it's a nice place for a casual Friday night glass of wine!",
            "Super cute wine bar ! Trendy decor, cute wall on the side of the building. The menu is phenomenal! Crispy Brussels  just get them! Great wine selections, beautiful custom ceramics. Good vibes all around",
            "Walked into this place expecting it to be just another mediocre hipster, trendy bar (which was fine in my book) but damn, was I blown away. The ambiance was great, which was unsurprising. But the flavor palette of everything we ordered was just above and beyond. First, we had the sweet potato tacos. Normally I just down everything in hot sauce, but these were so delicious I didn't want to add anything to subtract from the flavor palette. Then, we split the Brussels sprouts which were topped off with some incredible cheese. Tjird, we had the charcuterie which was an astonishing blend of meats and cheeses. The bread tasted fresh out of the oven. Drinks were delicious as well. Will definitely be back!",
            "Great vibes and nice staff! Delicious grilled cheese and decent variety of beers on tap."

            "Fog City has been pretty hot or miss for me over the years but I'm always willing to try things a few times and while having a quick business lunch the other day I was impressed with my order. I mean, it was damn delicious! I won't go into why this place is hit or miss because I don't want to bash the business but, lets just say in a past experience I wasn't able to eat for a few days due to some undercooked food. Damn shame I tell you. Anyway, it seems they've found their footing again and my salmon sandwich was really good. The service was also really lovely and attentive. I'm always a fan of fast service during lunchtime hours because we've all got stuff to do right?! I'll be back for that sandwich again because it really is a masterpiece.",
            "What else can be said about the Fog City Diner? That it might be the best Americana restaurant in San Fransisco. Everything I've ever had there, from the amazing flattened half chicken, to the oyster based appetizers to the strong drinks, has been too notch.The decor is well done. The staff is always impeccable. It's somewhat pricey but I think they'd get away with being more pricey. Suitable for celebrations, or just hanging out. If you want Americana fusion, you can't go wrong.",
            "We last came here years ago when it was known as Fog City Diner.  After a brief time closed, it emerged as Fog City. No matter the name, it's still one of the dining gems of the city. The food may not be adventurous or revolutionary, but sometimes being simple is just fine. All of their offerings are good tasting and a fair portion for the price. Enrique took good care of us as did the rest of the staff. We especially liked the Truffle Fries, Onion Rings, Brussels Sprouts, Burger, and Fried Chicken!  Get the Beignets if you have room in your stomach!",
            "This spot is a reinvented version of a old standard.Place has a pretty hip vibe.I have to say that the service is a problem.Took maybe 25 minutes to get a waiter to our table.And the wait staff was a revolving door during the night.Very odd.The food is great and very well imagined but they need to work on the service.I will be back for old time sake but not the service.",
            "Really enjoyed the ambiance at this restaurant.  Food was also high quality.  Would highly recommend; a unique dining experience.",
            "I'm not a local. It was actually my yelp app that helped me find this place. Partially I liked the name, partially I liked that I read they had good sangria.  I was having trouble deciding between the red and white sangria, so the bartender said \"want to sample both?\" UH YES? (Red won.) I got the salmon sandwich, was was good and came with a side salad which made me feel totally California.  It was in a convenient location to the pier where my touristy self was about to go take a tour of Alcatraz after lunch.  I'm glad I made the stop.",
            "We should have gone to a local diner. The Brussel sprouts are fried beyond recognition and the pulled pork sandwich had so much vinegar in it that the acidic fumes should have been enough to warn me off from taking the first bite. Our other dishes were not as offensive but certainlynot worthy of the cost. The view of the bay? Yes, from way across the street only if you sit on an odd angle. The noise level? Very loud. I'm sorry for the bad review but people should be warned.",
            "Went here for a company happy hour/dinner/team building event. It was a really nice restaurant and probably one of the better places I went to while I was in SF in August. We had a prix-fixe meal set because we were a very large group and I appreciated that a lot of the options were vegetarian. Let me talk about the highlight of my experience though: The onion rings. How did they take an already amazing food and make it EVEN BETTER? I don't know what they do to make the cuts of onion so small and delightful but those onion rings were the best I had in a really, really long time. I'd say...ever. in my life. and honestly, shout out to Fog City for dealing with 40 people drinking and having fun. My company at the time was a lot of young folks and they knew how to party. I appreciate the kindness of the staff and how nicely they treated us. (not going to lie and say I remember what I had for dinner...but I think it was the vegetarian lasagna. I'm not a huge pasta fanatic when I go out to eat but it was pretty good!)",
            "Came here for happy hour and left with a warm and full belly. I made reservation in case it got too busy for HH but when we came, it wasn't that busy. Maybe we beat the crowd to it. Service Service was great. Our waiter was very friendly. He was attentive and patient. Took his time to answer any questions we had before we ordered. Food I can only speak to the happy hour's food. Because, that's what we mainly ordered. We got oysters, truffle fries, deviled eggs, and fish tacos. My favorite were the oysters. The were fresh and small. I don't like big raw oysters because they tend to be more chewy. These were small and sweet. Both, my friend and I liked the fish tacos so we ordered a second round of that! I didn't take too much for the fries and deviled eggs. Overall, they had good happy hour menu and a nice environment.",
            "This place does not get the credit it deserves in some of these reviews. Anyways, in the many times I've been here (including last night), I have always received good service and good food. My go-to: Truffle Fries and the Fried Chicken entree. I will warn you of one thing though: Like everything else in SF, this place is expensive.",
            "Classic SF restaurant that is near the pier and has since been renovated. I like how they can hold a private large party and reservation in the corner of the restaurant.  The layout is like a diner, but my family was able to have the babies run around the corner area.  Casual dining with good eats! The skirt steak was seasoned well and they were accommodating with just veggies as choice of sides instead of fries! Beet sauce and asparagus was the substitute and it was great! Pork chop was grilled and cooked nicely as well!  Brussels sprouts were crisp as appetizer, Caesar salad was dressed up swell and trfries were addictive!  They gave little calamari and wings were on the dry side.  Fresh oysters - can't complain on that part. Thin beignets were ordered for dessert. Nicely puffed and fresh and dough to my liking.  The creamy espresso dip was more preferred than the chocolate. Service was attentive.Convenient and contemporary.",
            "Whenever we have family or friends come into town, this has become a go to place for us. It's easily accessible downtown with great food. They become very very busy during lunch, so we always make sure to get there early or make a reservation online. I highly recommend their pizzas and deviled eggs. Their signature cocktails are their only downfall in our opinion. For the price, the taste and overall substance isn't really there. Staff has always been kind, great location, ambience and food. Parking is easy with ample street (metered) and garage within walking distance",
            "The best part about San Francisco food is that they work sourdough into everything. You don't just have to go to Boudin Bakery and get soup in a sourdough bread bowl, though of course I did (yum).You can also just walk into a restaurant and they've found a way to incorporate it. At Fog City San Francisco, they have sourdough breadsticks on the menu, so of course I had to order those as an appetizer. Even though I carbo-loaded on the appetizer, I just had to order a Margherita pizza on thin sourdough crust. You know, because SF. It was amazing. I wish LA / SD would get with the sourdough obsession. But for now, I'll have to content myself with making foodie travels up north.",
            "Service is excellent here.  We came in the afternoon on the weekend and were seated right away.  This place is classy and also family friendly.  The menu is a bit expensive just like everything else in sf but the tuna salad is made by hand and all homemade (no canned tuna).  The sweet paprika chips were perfect and the pickled veggies were good too. The Caesar salad looked pretty good. And they have a view of The Embarcadero.",
            "We split a pizza and a porkchop and both were quite good. The porkchop had a bit of rawness near the bone but I prefer my restaurants to err on the side of rawness instead of overcooking it. The barley that came with the porkchop was probably the highlight.The pizza had a nice crust but it's nothing to write home about exactly. It's certainly a fine pizza but their other stuff seems more interesting.",
            "This is an alright place in an area that is hard to find really good places.   Very trendy very hip, bar is nice and a really good place to get small orders or appetizers.  This is the type of place you take a break have a small meal and continue on.   So it is good, but just have the right expectation when you arrive.  Pricey but comparable to the area.",
            "My company is close to this restaurant so we visit it a lot. I took my daughter to it during one winter break weekday at around 2:30p. After we sat down for a few minutes, a mouse came out from somewhere, ran right in front of my feet and ran all the way across the restaurant. I was shocked. I told one of the waiters and he did apologize and said that's probably because they are the only one restaurant on that side of the park. The food taste great and services are good. But if you can see a mouse, there are usually more behind the scenes. I would not visit it again.",
            "Worst customer service ever. My pizza looked like it had been sitting around for hours. Tasted like it too. Usually come here in The day.... won't come back at noght",
            "Dinner Review:LOCATION: Nice spot across the street from the bay, but even the part of the restaurant that faces the bay has an obstructed view.DRINKS: Reasonably priced for SF (Beers around $8, cocktails around $12). My moscow mule on tap was delivered quickly and was very enjoyable.FOOD: We shared the breadsticks, cod fritters, and their famous FC Fried Chicken. The breadsticks were fine, but there were only 3 and they're quite small. The salt cod fritters were fine as well. The fried chicken was pretty good but it did not blow me away, nor did the mashed potatoes or the cole slaw. I'm sure that it is a hit with a lot of meat and potatoes people, but I am always on the lookout for more exciting takes on such classics like fried chicken. DESSERT: Skipped it in favor of walking along the embarcadero to Ghiradelli. OVERALL: Menu wasn't super inventive, and it was, like most people say, a little pricey for what you get. It seems like you won't have trouble getting a seat at the bar or a table, so there's a silver lining if you're looking for it. Overall, A-OK but I am not rushing to go back with all the great restaurants in SF.",
            "3.5 stars.This is one of those classic places I've wanted to come to since long before I moved to the city. I remember as a kid driving by here and it looked awesome!When I finally was old enough to come myself I had heard it wasn't great so I never made it a priority.A little while back they closed for a good amount of time for a fresh coat of paint and I'm sure a few million $ in new carpet and new menu items. It's beautiful inside and the menu choices are great. Really it's nice. Check out that super chill oven!!The service is great and location can't be beat. If you live more than a hundred miles from here I think you might like it and I encourage you to stop in. The service is excellent. Very friendly, attentive, and personable. Obviously the management is excellent. If your a local or a foodie snob this classic joint just doesn't cut it. I got excited when I read somewhere that they had one of the best burgers in the city. It's good, I'll give 'em that but it's not spectacular. The bun was good but not matched perfectly because it demands just a little too much of my attention; pulling me away from the excellently prepared meat. (This is the inner food snob.) When I'm paying taxes on my $18 Cheeseburger and Fries of 12.5% (it's complicated) I need you to give me something above and beyond.We won't be back any time soon but if a friend from out of town mentions it, I'll gladly accompany them.I don't know if they take AMEX."

            "I came here for Saint Patrick's Day weekend after walking around the downtown area with friends and watching the parade at the block party down the street. First time here and could say that the bar was nice in atmosphere, decor was lit and theme was on point. I may have had one or two many drinks. Also leading to accidentally leaving my wallet somewhere in the lounge. Luckily I contacted the day after and the bartender told me that they found it and I could pick it up at the bar. The honest reply of the staff and the experience at the club made it a fun night",
            "One of my favorite places to come when out on the town. Absolutely love the decoration and style of this place. So loungy which a great bar. Music/DJ could be a bit better though. Definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in the area. -B",
            "After my terrible experience the last time I was here, the manager offered to send me a gift card to give this place another chance. Never received the gift card but decided to bring my team here for a happy hour anyway. Made a reservation for a party of 15. Arrived and the host said she couldn't find my reservation. She also kept asking if the reservation was under \"Barbara\" as there was clearly a table saved for a large party under Barbara by the front door. She disappeared for 10 minutes while my group is just standing there at the door waiting to be seated. When she eventually comes back, she confirms that she does not have my reservation and after I showed her the confirmation email, she disappears again to speak to the manager! Finally, she comes back and says that she has a table for us, she walks us to a table that fits 5-6 people. Did she just expect the rest of us to stand????!! She mentioned that she would be bringing stools but judging by the looks of it, we still would not fit with stools around the table. More time passes and she doesn't bring stools or menus so we decided to leave and give our business to another bar. Very disappointing considering the entire place was practically empty with the exception of a few folks. I used to be a regular here but after my two recent experiences, I will not be returning.",
            "Just love this place, every single time I went there I Had a great time, they have Amazing cocktails, the music is great, good crowd sometimes a little \" hungry \" !:-) thé bathroom are just amazing and you can get some education while waiting for it! Great service too, we took a table for my birthday (that's how much I like the place! ) it was fast efficient and great staff!",
            "I came here on a weekend around 10 PM and this place was lit! It was greened out for St. Patty's day and had fun music and enough space for a lot of people. I would describe this place as a trendy-ish bar that is also laid back, and has a good mix of people! From bankers to fashion designers...Plus, the bartenders were super nice and the drinks were also pretty good for a clubby bar. Highly recommend coming here!",
            "Saturday November 3 - Celebrated my 30th birthday. I was looking for an intimate lounge with lots of space and room for friends to mingle, good bar food, and excellent cocktails. Barbarossa hit all the requirements!Reservations - Required but only holds your spot for 3 hours. They kicked us out at 11:00PM for the next party but we were welcomed to take the party downstairs.Interior - Space is very spacious, romantic yet casual. Space is segregated by pretty lounge seats that require reservation. The rest of the venue is open for walk-ins.Highbinder (tequila, ancho reyes, guava, basil, lemon) - Refreshing, sweet guava taste, crisp. Ordered it again because it was that good. Downstairs has a DJ area for dancing and more drinks.",
            "Eduardo just made me the best surprise cocktail for me, after 9 months with no cocktails too :) it was just what I needed! We named it the Cherry Hooker! Champs, vodka... agave and those cherries that are usually in old fashioned that I loveeeeee! Spot on",
            "Fun place . DJ is modern and not too funky! Bar is ok.back room if you have a bigger group",
            "A neat hangout for an upper 20s crowd. It's basically a night club. Music: Top 40, commercial. Crowd: dress to impress. Diverse, young professionals. A good mix of guys and girls. Ambiance: modern-shick with a masculine vibe. DJ: yes.   The space is larger than it appears. The basement has another bar, and the back of the club goes pretty far too. The bar was over so crowded we couldn't get a drink. The thirsty patrons were also pushy at the bar. I felt old with all the 20 something year olds, couldn't sit ( despite it being a lounge) and quite frankly didn't feel like fighting for a drink. So we left. I would be curious to check this place out on a weeknight, but def not on a weekend.",
            "Very aesthetic place with really nice music. Theres great photo spots too! Good place to just hang out with friends and have a low key night. If you want to  party harder, there's plenty of space to stand and dance too. The menu is also quite unique and interesting. My boyfriend had a whiskey based drink that was topped with whipped cream and cinnamon!",
            "HAPPY NEW YEAR 2019!I couldn't think of a better venue to have spent it on New Year's Eve with my friends.I heard good things about Barbarossa but have never been here. Around 15 of my friends and I decided last minute to purchase NYE tickets for Barbarossa and everyone was happy to have made the right choice.The staff including security, reception were great, friendly and everyone was in a super great mood to celebrate an amazing night.A super classy venue filled with black, silver and gold decors, balloons and other accessories that made this night very festive. Of course, everyone wanted to take photos with the huge \"2 0 1 9\" balloons.It was super crowded and I believe for normal nights it would be similar.Barbarossa has 2 floors, several bars and is located right across from the Transamerica Pyramid building and around 10 min walk to the pier which made it easy for us to walk down to watch the fireworks for the countdown.The one and only thing I was not impressed with was the sound system.It's a great bar, lounge to have some drinks after dinner and to take a walk at the pier right after.",
            "Had a Holiday Party to attend here last night! Great place! Had a good lineup of libations, and the music started pumping after 9... as did the crowd. Note! It gets so crowded you can barely move and there are lines outside .. so get in early and stay late!Cheers!",
            "Prerequisite- may or may not have \"lost\" a corporate card here a time or two if that shows how happy hours go down here.What a great spot for the happiest hours of the day. Located right between the financial district and north beach, this hot spot is popular with those working around the Trans America pyramid. While the theme is very bondage, it is a great atmosphere to entertain teams, clients, coworkers, and friends. They take reservations in advance for large groups where you get to sit at the couch areas. The best spot is the very front table as it sits the most people. Also a plus is that they don't have a minimum for larger reservations - which is why it is so busy during the week. In terms of the HH menu, the champagne flight is $15 and we took full advantage of it. They should have just given us the bottles. You can Chandon brut, Piper, and iron horse in your flight. So many bubbles! They also do house glasses of wine or red and beer flights at happy hour prices. Food wise we tried the cheese plate (yum), charcuterie plate (didn't try but group said yum), Brussels (yum), caprese salad (YUMMMM), pulled pork sliders (didn't try but group said yum), and hummus trio (yummm). Safe to say we absolutely hated it and didn't even touch the food....YEAH RIGHT. I recommend it all especially the Brussels, caprese salad and hummus! Wait staff fairly attentive but the absolute best way to do Barbarossa is by reserving a table. The bar gets packed so get there early if you don't have a reservation so you can snag a high top!",
            "Hmmm I'm not sure I how I feel about this place .. I might be biased because I prefer partying to hip hop music and not the top 40s that this place seems to play over and over again. But then again, everyone is different and I'm sure a lot of folks really enjoy coming here. The building itself is very narrow and long. There's a basement level with a dance floor and restrooms. We decided to get bottle service for my friends birthday. The bottles are slightly cheaper than Temple SF. But it's a very different atmosphere, partly because of where this lounge is located (financial district, and I mean young chic crowd mixed with middle aged suit wearing adults). Should've done my research and checked out what kind of place it was before making table reservations. Our server was really nice and didn't mind that our whole group didn't show up at the same time. She was willing to walk back and forth to get our guests in, so for her, 5 stars! One of the bussers knocked over an entire bottle of alcohol and broke a few glasses. He tried picking up the bottle and just knocked it over again and didn't even do anything about the broken glass. I had to warn everyone about it and call the server over to clean up the mess before anyone got hurt. In the end, they were going to charge us full price for that bottle until I made a complaint. They then gave us a discount, which I really appreciated. Overall, the staff was very accommodating. I do feel that some things could've been handled in a better way, but I'm not too bummed about my experience here. It's just not really my scene and that's ok. Not everything is for everyone!",
            "Used to be a jail house, now an interesting juxtaposition or exposed bricks and luxurious furniture with a flavor of res light district. Delicious cocktails emphasizing their \"Barbary Coast sensibility\"( interesting names too, such as kalefornication), while food menu is small but with good choices to complement the cocktails. The place gets busy later at night during weekend, but if you come early, before 8pm, you probably don't need reservation and you can use the place for a nice photo shoot!",
            "Barbarossa Lounge is a great HH establishment to go after a long day at work! If you're able to catch this place on a Mondays, they have $1 oysters. Great food and drink options! My bartender, Eduardo, provided a relaxing atmosphere with excellent service and suggestions. Highly recommend for solo, couples, or work groups. Cheers!",
            "Good music, good service, fun vibes! Love going there Saturday nights- always a little bit of a line but worth it! There's a downstairs too with diff music - also super fun!",
            "Came here for a friend's birthday gathering. You can reserve tables for free! Drinks were great, and I loved that there was so much space before 11pm. The place does get suuuuper packed as the night goes on though, and getting drinks at the bar becomes super painful. Would return but would also likely leave before 11pm to avoid the crowds.",
            "Eduardo is amazing! Cool little spot in the city if you want to grab a bite. Chill and good music.",
            "this is a provocative place. you'll know what i mean when you see the decors inside. bird cage chandeliers and handcuffs... even on the bathroom wall - look close!my drink was a mezcal and tequila base topped with a cherry and orange peel kebab decor. make sure you take a bite of the cherry! it compliments the flavors of the cocktailthe seating is definitely comfortable with couches and personal sofas. group gathering of 10-12 people is fitting here as the u-shape setup allows you to socialize intimately (rather than the usual bar table and chair or beer garden long table and long bench style).they also have a projector and an at least 80\" screen"

The mexi-bowls are so good and ordering it is so easy.Lunch time is from 10:30 to 2:00!First, you wait in the long line. Even if you try to get there early, there's already a line out the door. Second, when you get to the window you have to choose your vessel and that includes Mexican rice, quinoa, vegetables or greens. Next, you choose the meat - carnitas, chicken or roasted vegetables. Last, you choose the sauce. I always go for the chimchurri sauce. I'm not a spice or hot fan so I'd recommend this one. As soon as you're done paying, most of the time your order is ready to go. Just like that, you're on your way back to the office to eat this delicious bowl packed with goodness.",
            "Ordered the half rice and half veggies bowl with pork. I also included the black beans and sauce into the mix. The rice and veggies were pretty good and the pork was well seasoned. The beans were actually too salty which made the bowl itself quite salty. Other than that, isolating the beans, the bowl was good.",

You choose from rice, greens, quinoa, or veggies as your base, and then you can add pork (carnitas), chicken (pollo al horno), or more veggies on top.Prices might look a tad spendy on the surface, but they're on par with everything in this area at lunchtime, and your servings will be bigger than that of Chipotle (admittedly not the most flattering comparison but still the one that first comes to mind). Pro tip: try ordering online before you head here as they're minimally staffed and the in-person waits can be quite long.",
            "I ride my bike from Soma to Chica to get a bowl for lunch at least once a month! The bowls are very well made and taste amazing! They have 4 different sauces so if you try something that doesn't amaze you, try something else next time. All the other ingredients are fresh and tasty. I usually get the black beans, rice, veggies and avocado dressed with the chimichurri sauce, it's the best combo I've found so far.",
            "Amazing place for lunch! The rice + carnitas + chimichurri is my go to. The rice is phenomenal -- so well seasoned and bursting with flavor. It, paired with the pork, makes for a very rich, satisfying meal. Comes with sides of cucumbers, guac, and pickled onions, which add a bright note to the meal. Chica itself is just a little window (easy to spot, because of the line that inevitably builds up during lunch), but Levi's Plaza is just a block up, and a great place to enjoy your mexi-bowl!",
            "Mmmm, bomb.com! Carnitas bowl with chimichuri is awesome. Get there early so you won't miss out on their veggies if the day. They offer a base of Mexi-rice, quinoa or arugula. Three different sauces. You're order is out about a minute after the order is placed. Solid!",
            "The b/w photo serves as an accurate depiction of this little place.  Had the carnitas with rice.  It was very good, decent size portion for the price.  Polite and quick service.  I'd go back.",
            "I visit Chica pretty regularly to pick up lunch. This place never disappoints. I mostly end up getting the Veggie Medley and absolutely love it - loads of fresh veggies on a bed of Mexican rice and a dollop of guacamole. Couldn't expect it to get any better! The queue to order is sometimes a little long so the earlier you reach, the better. Highly recommend this cute little window to get lunch.",
            "I LOVE this place. I used to work down the street and tried to come as often as possible because the food is THAT good. Think chipotle burrito bowls but more authentic and extremely tasty. There's 1 walk-up window and usually a line during the lunch rush, so I try to go at 1PM or later when the line is a bit shorter.My usual is a mexi-bowl with rice, carnitas and chimichurri sauce. All orders come with guacamole, pickled veggies and pita seeds on top and wow, they are incredible. The meat is always very flavorful, vegetables fresh, and all the sauces are killer. You can customize the base (rice, quinoa, salad mix), and choose meat or vegetarian options for the protein.  The portions are extremely generous for a $10 lunch and I sometimes save half for later (when I have self control). Protip: head to Levi's plaza after on a sunny day to devour your bowl in peace.",
            "Fast and efficient service at this takeout window will make CHICA popular for office workers looking for a quick grab and go. Pretty straightforward Mexican lunch fare consisting of rice bowls with the option of chicken, carnitas, and rotating veggie options. I thought my chicken was well seasoned and combined well with the rice. The combination of the pickles, slaw, and avocado make balance out the plate with some brightness and crunch. It looks like a lot of food when you first open the box but it's not actually that much once you start digging in. Nice variety though that comes in just over $10. The line moves fast and they take cards which makes CHICA a good fallback lunch option.",
            "I hate writing semi ok reviews... but the food was not that great... I ordered a veggie bowl with their famous bbq sauce... and it was sooo salty. I felt my blood pressure going up. And some of the ingredients in the food was too acidic causing my tummy to be in pain. I had really acid reflux afterwards...not sure if it was just me... but I am still having tummy pains.",
            "I had Pollo Al Horno with Huacatay sauce & it tasted delicious, a truly Mexican delight to have for a sumptuous lunch.",
            "Prices going up, portions and quality going down.  Unless you're a 20-something East Coast marketing chick transplant wanting to be \"seen\" in jeans and heels, towering over the guy in front of you in line (you wait along a steep slope), your $11.43 for a mexi-bowl with sour guacamole and sloppy rice is better spent somewhere else.  Like anywhere really....",
            "I really want to like this place because the staff is friendly and the food is high quality.  However I have two major issues:Inconsistent hours - I've been there a couple times when they're supposed to be open and they're completely closed.Inconsistent portions - sometimes the portion is perfect but sometimes it's very skimpy especially for the price. My bowl today was mostly rice.",
            "I work nearby and so decided to stop by, and I'm so glad I did. I would have included a photo with this review, but it looked too good and I was too hungry to do so! It tastes great -- you can really tell their ingredients are thoughtfully chosen and prepared. It was $16 for a bowl with chips and guacamole, and given the value, I think it's perfectly fair. See you soon, Chica!",
            "This place is literally a hole in the wall and I mean that in the most loving and affectionate way possible, and also because it quite literally is. A hole in the wall. Even after looking up directions - I almost walked right past this place. I opted for the carnitas bowl with half veggies + quinoa. YUM! This it's definitely a very healthy portion of comida. It could easily be saved for be enjoyed for two lunches if you a) have the self control, and b) have the self control. I really liked the pickled veggies as well. I don,t know what all was in there, but they had some punch!This is a definite repeat!",
            "A literal hole in the wall across the street from my office, but it's a great place to grab a quick and delicious lunch. My usual order is the carnitas on quinoa salad with extra mole BBQ sauce (the sauce is GREAT) and while it sets me back $12, that price is comparable to the food trucks a block away and I would say CHICA is better. I get a HUGE portion of carnitas and quinoa salad, and every meal comes with guac and some really good pickled veggies. The pickled veggies are honestly awesome- they're fresh, sour, and provide a good balance for the richness of everything else. The line does get a bit long at lunch time because of all of the offices in the area, but the food comes out quickly and tastes great!",
            "Conveniently located across the street from the office so I went to try their breakfast. You order from a small window and their menu had a decent amount of items for a small spot. The breakfast sandwich is the only thing that sounded appealing on their breakfast selection. The jamón tasted slightly like procuitto which isn't a bad thing. The sandwich was warm and soft. You get all the ingredients in one bite which is amazing! It wasn't dry at all. I wish they sold agua fresca though.",
            "literally a hole in the wall restaurant, good food, and fast service. Ask for extra sauce because the food can be a little bit dry. Overall a good place for takeout.",
            "These guys used to be good, but their quality has really suffered over the past year. They're pretty inconsistent - one day, not bad, the next terrible... I tried to stay loyal since there aren't a lot of options in the neighborhood, but I just can't do it anymore."

            "This place is just short of amazing, its small homey and the breakfast sandwiches are the bomb!! Super friendly counter staff, all around great place.",
            "Met a friend here on a Sunday morning around 10:30am. It's such a tiny place, but waited a bit and were able to get a table outside. I got the Daily Toast (~$8), and it was beautifully presented with lots and lots of fruit. I loved the mascarpone spread, definitely decadent. It was a pretty big size which I liked, but definitely on the sweeter side from the fruit. My friend got the Egg on a Croissant (~$8) because she was told it was one of the most popular items. She said that even though it doesn't look filling it actually is. She also said the croissant was nice and flaky and the sauce went well on it! I got a Tumeric latte (~$5), which I felt was way too foamy and watered down. My friend got the Matcha Chai latte (~5), which I tried and liked it way better than mine! Overall, super cute spot and I'd come back here again.",
            "If you are wanting to avoid the crowd and grab a seat in this tiny establishment, come early! I had no issues with a large crowd but by 9AM, it can be quite jammed. The menu isn't too extensive, and the items are very simple. I ordered the egg on croissant and was happy with the overall meal. I do love their vision and goal of this tiny cafe, but I feel it is a tad bit overpriced or they need to offer real dishware versus paper. At $8, it was steep for the small size, especially knowing the croissant most likely was outsourced. If you don't dive that deep into it and care for quality only and not price, don't fear!The gentleman who took and made our order was extremely nice and enhanced the overall experience! He was knowledgeable of the menu and coffees and could answer any question we had. I'd return for the great service.All in all, if you want a quick, casual breakfast, this is a wonderful option. It is surrounded by hotels though, so be aware it could be filled with lots of tourists in case that's not your thing.",
            "It was early in the morning and I was looking for a cool spot to grab some breakfast. I heard about the matcha latte at Farm : Table, so I decided to drop by. I rarely get to come to Lower Nob Hill these days, so it felt nice to be back in the hood.AMBIANCE is... nice, but tight. There's not much space inside at all, and when I came inside there was a large group (family) at the only table inside the space. Definitely a home grown vibe with the woods and scrappy setup, but also felt a little pretentious. The customer service was cold and transactional. ORDERED house cereal ($7.95) and matcha chai latte ($3.95).FOOD was ok. The soy milk must have been frozen, because it tasted quite gritty as I ate the cereal. The saving grace was the matcha chai latte, which was served at a nice temperature and had a nice balance of ingredients.OVERALL a thoughtful three stars. Not a great experience, but a fine to-go option for matcha in the future.",
            "Everything here was extremely fresh. I got the daily toast and charcoal latte. Both were unique, but the charcoal latte was outstanding. I would go here again for the charcoal latte at least. It does not have many seats, so if you are ok to get something to go, that maybe a good option too.",
            "This place is pretty great! Their daily toast is the talk of the town. The combination of fresh fruit atop a fluffy slice of brioche bread with the mascarpone spread, can we say little slice of heaven!! The space is little cramped, but hey, big things come in small packages right. If you're ever in the city, stop in and get you a slice.",
            "The store itself is very small! I was able to snag a seat at a table outside the entrance, which was fine because luckily the weather was great. I got the daily toast, which I would recommend if you like fresh fruit. It wasn't overly sweet and was enough for a light breakfast. I'd go back if I was in the area again early in the morning.",
            "Cute small breakfast place. You will have to wait in line but it moves pretty fast. Everything is super fresh. I ordered the house cereal and a latte. The yogurt was a little runny but pretty good. I got the toast with cheese and fruit last time and would probably get that over the house cereal if I went back. The place is pretty pricey but always has customers. Great customer service.",
            "I really liked this spot! The coffee and service was great. They have a delicious Kouign-Amann which is usually hard for me to find in the first place but especially one as well done as this. It was perfectly caramelized and just gooey enough in the middle. YUM! (Way better than Manresa's in Los Gatos) I am from San Diego and no one has ever hear of a Kouign-Amann so it was really cool to stumble upon some at this spot.",
            "Just alright! Let's talk through some of the top items:1) daily toastIt sure is absolutely instagrammable, and the whip cream is definitely nice and unique. Definitely leaves you thinking about it. BUT, the crust was burnt tasting for our taste, and didn't love the texture of the bread. PLUS, the overall bite just wasn't amazing.2) croissant breakfast sandwichIt sure is a decent croissant. But the egg isn't runny, and there's not much else special to the sandwich. No lovable aoili, or other amazing element. Again, it did look beautiful. Loved the cheese and its melt. Good, but not SF institution quality. Same as 1.3) charcoal latteQuite nice. Not too sweet. But a hint too much cinnamon for our taste. Overall not the best specialty latte but a nice one. The mocha and charcoal definitely come through. And tasty, well pulled espresso, as well as steamed milk are always welcome.4) flat whiteOur milk was a bit scalded. It almost burned to drink. So this wasn't your typical Australian coffee drink. But the espresso was indeed quite good.Arriving at 8:30am is the move. No line and got seats. Nice vibes when not too busy and nice staff. Nice people to bump elbows with nearby too.Overall-not sure why this is an SF institution. It's no tartine, mill, b patisserie, or any of the other places we SFers cue for. But a nice California spot!",
            "Delicious egg breakfast sandwich with a honey latte to wash it all down-- happy tummy! There is very limited seating but their menu consists of items able to enjoy standing or hanging out outside. Perfect for the on the run-grab-and-go. Their only but very popular crispy breakfast sandwich croissant is packed with romaine, ham, sliced egg and just enough of their spread. It can get a little messy but so worth it!Will be back to try their charcoal latte & their toast!",
            "A really small place with a few tables outside. I wish their menu had more choices. Their coffee is nice (flat white) and they are friendly. The avocado toast was nice. Kind of overpriced in my opinion (salmon toast, avocado toast + flat white $31)",
            "I thought I would be turned away for not wearing a retro hat or sporting expensive ear buds.Cosy venue with limited seating indoors and only one person taking orders, making coffee and delivering. The constant line of 3-4 diners kept the poor girl busy. Kudos to her for remaining calm and polite. The lack of indoor seating means that you have to hit the street. Benches, tables and a wooden garden nook (?) plus an iron railing were eclectic but surprisingly comfortable and convenient. All I had was a flat white. It was good, real good. I overheard others commenting positively on crispy croissants, fruit topped toast and other dishes. The aforementioned hatted hipsters disappeared into an Uber. After the initial hipster shock the crowd became more diverse and I didn't feel so out of place. Cool spot.",
            "Came here to get a bite with friends and talk, but did not foresee that the place would be super small! There is barely enough room to squeeze a line as well as one dining table inside. We felt a bit weird about ranting to each other about our lives in such a communal space so we opted to sit outside at one of their provided outdoor seating areas. As for the food, I got the Salmon Toast and the Frank the Pug Honey Latte with Almond Milk. I understand everything is supposed to be locally sourced, and this is also SF, but my order came out to $20 for one slice of toast and one latte. I think what bothered me is that the prices aren't listed on the menu- which also is a thing for locally sourced food (I'm assuming???). But I couldn't help but feel like I was paying more for what things were really worth. Taste wise, the salmon and toppings on the toast were good, and the salad was refreshing. My piece of bread was pretty rock hard, but I gotta make the most of my $20 experience so I ate it all. As for the latte, I could taste the honey but not the almond milk. I ended up having to put more sugar in because it still tasted like regular black coffee with a hint of honey. The service was pretty good though- the person who served our drinks and food was super nice and also made the experience a bit more enjoyable. Overall, it is a cute (read: but TINY) place. I don't think it's worth the pricing, I don't really understand the hype for it, and I also don't plan on returning or trying it again. If you're really curious, it's nice to try at least once. Though I'm sure you can also find better places.",
            "I took a friend here for brunch before she left for the airport as it was right across the street from my apartment.  This place was always packed on the weekends so I assumed that it would be amazingly delicious.  That being said, it was not quite up to my expectations.  I ordered the following:Salmon Toast: smoked salmon on a dill cream spread with sproutsPROS:- dill spread did not overwhelm me with the taste of ... all herb.  Dill in particular, can be very strong so the balance needs to be just right.- toast was not soggy meaning it was fresh made and came out quick- side salad was a nice refreshing touch given that the toast itself was on the heavier end of the mealCONS: - it'd be nice to have a little more salmon.  I realize smoked salmon is expensive, but even the bagels in NYC have more salmon and that's a staple for the city.  Not to mention, the price for this salmon toast was equivalent if not more than what I would get for a similar item.  The one thing that I didn't quite like was the limited seating.  Inside had one large table with wall seats (as in a bench built into the window).  Private seating was located outside with maybe three small tables.  If the weather is bad which, can actually happen in the Bay, it doesn't bode well for eating in (or out rather).  Given that I live across the street, my toast probably would be able to survive the soggy-test had I decided to take my order to-go.  Overall, it's nice but I wouldn't wait in line here on the weekend for this.",
            "The only thing I wish I could change about this place is their pricing. Holy cow I spent over $25 for some toast, a slice of quiche and coffee!!! It was friggin tasty though. DAILY TOAST - they don't have a typical fruit they top this with, but it's a thick slice of sweet breath topped with  mascarpone and fruit. I didn't want to like it, but by golly it was good!! Idk if it's $9 good, but it's up there. I'd give it a 8/10 mostly because of the price. It would be a splurge type of thing more than anything else.  SAVORY PIE - I ordered the veggie + meat. It was great, but not for $12!!! It was yummy for a quiche, but not for that price. 7/10Overall it's a super cute restaurant, but it wouldn't be a consistent breakfast place for me (I'd be broke!!). I also wasn't a huge fan that the prices weren't listed. Their pricing online is cheaper than what they charged me. They were a 3.5/5 for me.",
            "Omg what a breakfast  If you are in SF you have to check this place out!! The egg on croissant is heaven.",
            "Here on business and found this small but very nice place to have breakfast.  The food was great and the ingredients were fresh.Will definitely come back next time I'm in San Fransisco.",
            "Ok I don't get the fan fare about this place. It's small and dingy. I went in about 45 mins close to closing, 12:15 which is normal lunch time and the one table was dirty and the place was occupied by the owners dogs. They don't really have prices because it depends on the food, but i got the smoked salmon. They literally pulled out a slice of wheat bread from a bag from safeway. The workers were all having a conversation about different things that suck (okay a customer is right there). At the end of it, my small little bread and salmon was over $13. They also had another brioche typed bread stored under their toaster oven, with the top half squeezed under it. It all looked very unsanitary.",
            "We thought this was more of a sit-down brunch place so were kind of disappointed to find it to be so small with not much seating and meant to be for quick-bites. However, don't be deterred by the lack of seating or feel you have to eat quickly. The service is very friendly and the food is really good. The Daily Toast is *chef kisses fingers* with quality brioche, mascarpone spread, lots of fruit (wide variety), and nuts. Yeah, I could maybe make it at home, but there was lots of fruit and honestly well-worth $8. Of course, it's very Instagrammable. My friend liked her egg on croissant. My Frank the Pug Honey Latte was warm and sweet, but not overly so. I'd be back but definitely plan to get your food to-go. The menu doesn't really have prices but it's pretty reasonable for San Francisco and something that looks so aesthetic."

            "4 stars because of the wait. We were on the yelp waitlist and it took us 70 minutes to be seated. Food was good but wasn't worth that long of a wait in my opinion. I got the lean skillet which was pretty good, not a ton of flavor so i got some Pico de Gallo (wouldn't have gotten 2 orders of it if i knew they were each $2 extra). Overall a decent spot but won't ever wait that long to eat there again. ALSO - to note they have no liquor license so they don't have real Bloody Mary's.",
            "Just had lunch at a great New Spot! Avocado toast, French onion soup with plenty of cheese, cob salad with salmon and zing. Great service. Wide diner menu for brunch, lunch and early dinner. Recommended.Dinner today - crab cake, southern chicken, & milk shake all great. My only concern is the prices are too low! Want them to succeed and remain here for years.Doing very well - enjoying the best Avocado toast in San Fran.3/29/19 back again for Reuben & avocado toast! So good!",
            "This place is unassuming and that works 100% for them because that means they can concentrate on the food and service. We stopped here for breakfast and everything was fantastic! I ordered an iced coffee even though they have a variety of reasonably priced espresso drinks. For my meal, I got the avocado toast with an order of breakfast potatoes and there was barely a crumb left on my plate. If you can appreciate a pimped out avocado toast, the New Spot on Polk is the place for you. Not only is it decked out with bacon but it had a perfectly cooked egg stop and once broken, gave me just enough yolk porn for the day. I almost went back that night to get the arugula and beet salad but I will have to save that for another day!",
            "I don't know where to start. I have never been in a situation that started out rough and was so quickly turned around. My family did an Uber eats type of delivery through the yelp app. The food arrived a little late and was cold. A couple of pieces of toast were charred. Since we rely on yelp when checking places out, we went straight to reviewing the establishment. That's when things got awesome.Sam, the owner and manager responded to a review, 1st with ab apology then asking how he could make the situation better. We told him we have a few more days in town and we would stop by and see him. He gave us his cell and asked when we were coming to make sure we were treated with care. The morning we went to eat there, I text Sam on his cell to let him know I was coming. I was so happy with how he handled the situation that I brought more family with me! We showed up and he made sure we were seated and our waitress was very attentive to our needs. After the meal we discussed again the debacle the first time and we were glad we came back to give it and him another shot!  The food was plentiful and well priced for San Francisco. I ate a breakfast burrito that made me want to lean over and punch my neighbor. It was huge but I ate the whole thing and scooped up every scrap on the plate! So here's the deal. We did get a slice of toast that was burnt the first time around and Sam immediately apologized and made sure to reinforce to the staff that there was no excuse for that type of service, he then reached out to us to see if he can make it right. And he did. He treated my e tire family of 9 very well and even gave a treat to my little one. I am now back home from my vacation and I get a text. Who is it from? SAM! He text to say he hopes we made it home well and that it was a pleasure to meet my family (I mean, we ARE pretty fun!)We write scathing reviews when we feel mistreated as customers, but we try to keep a balance and give a good review when we are treated well. As you can see in the reviews here, if something goes wrong, Sam is quick to respond and help make things right. Thanks Sam!!!And I almost forgot. I mentioned Uber eats through here. It really sucks because those delivery services stack orders so as the person comes in to grab my food because it is ready, they wait around another 15-30 minutes to pick up another order and make it in one trip. This should not be allowed. The restaurant owners have no say and no recourse when this happens. So when it does make sure to complain to the service about your cold food, maybe we can change it so they don't stack orders. Cold eggs... not so good!",
            "Came here by myself for an early dinner, had just gotten off a long flight. Overall a very positive experience, chose the Chicken Fried Steak which was delicious!I frequent the south quite a bit, and the sausage gravy tasted like you'd get in the best part of the Carolinas. Biscuit was a great, crumbly quality. Get the eggs Benedict style. Good for groups and was fine as a solo eater if you're there during a lull period. Would go again!",
            "The backstory behind this not-so-new cafe is both enterprising and heartwarming. A longtime employee of Polkers' Gourmet Burgers decided to open this corner spot when Polkers suddenly closed, and she hired a dozen of her former colleagues to staff what was a Chinese restaurant before. This was nearly two years ago, and it continues to survive on a more residential stretch of Polk across the street from the popular Leopold's. Truth be told, I wasn't bowled over by the service here, but I thought the food was reasonably good for the all-American fare they serve here. I ordered the $13 Arugula and Beets Salad.It was a sweetly pleasant mix of arugula, other organic greens, roasted beets, strawberries, dried cranberries, and walnuts doused with a balsamic vinaigrette (photo: bit.ly/2SSoZcX). There were a couple of toasted baguette slices that served as makeshift croutons. As if I didn't have enough fruit, I also ordered the $3 Fruit Cup which was festooned with berries over citrus and apple slices (photo: bit.ly/2E1UrLr). The staff appeared friendly toward each other and to regulars, though I have to divulge I wasn't feeling it as a first-time customer here. That probably won't prevent me from coming back to try the other diner fare since they offer eight other salads and a whole lotta burgers.FOOD - 4 stars...solid enough saladsAMBIANCE - 3 stars...average all things considered SERVICE - 2.5 stars...perfunctory at least to meTOTAL - 3 stars...hopefully I'll get the love that other customers gotRELATED - Looking for other dining options on Russian Hill? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed: bit.ly/2NAioAd",
            "Cute brunch location. The interior looks very old school and despite being very busy the tables aren't spaced too cramped so there is plenty of space around. There was quite a wait even using the Yelp check in on the app, although they were very organized about getting people through and getting the line moving. Service was very prompt and attentive although not overly friendly, and the food came out pretty quickly and coffee was pretty quickly refilled. The menu was a bit on the pricey side, with most of the brunch options costing in the ~$15 area. The serving sizes are fairly normal, but a little small if you are expecting large brunch portions.  The eggs Benedict was solid but a bit overpriced for what you get. The selection was two eggs and you have the option to pick what meat you get - they have the usual selection of different hams, as well as crab cakes, bacon, and veggies. First time I had seen this selection so was a pretty cool option. They have a decent selection of omelettes which are pretty huge, and could definitely serve two. You can get a fruit bowl instead of the potatoes for $2 extra. the fruit comes with a selection of strawberries, blueberries and melons.Overall, solid brunch but not sure if it was worth the wait.",
            "Update: I come here at least once a week/every two weeks now, and everything is great!! Service is fantastic (I initially said it wasn't stellar, but it's definitely improved a ton/maybe those earlier times were just exceptions). Also updating with some more food pics! Recommendations:* The Original* Avocado toast (always) * The Lean omelette * The Denver omelette * Breakfast sandwich",
            "Perfect spot for a great brunch. Can get busy on weekends however worth the wait. Portions are big.",
            "Lovely place. Seated quickly (despite its popularity and general businesses), wait time for order was more than 15 minutes, BUT well worth it for the quality preparation, cooking, and presentation put into the meals.",
            "EDIT: I originally posted the review below. I'm leaving it so you can see our original experience, but I've updated my review to 5 stars. We ordered food for delivery through Grubhub and didn't have a great experience. I posted our review and Sam, the owner, immediately reached out personally to apologize and ask us to try them again. We did - and are so glad. Sam and all his employees were gracious and kind...AND the food was absolutely delicious! The bacon was perfect (and so was the toast!). Plus, we went in person this time and the decor is so cute! I wish we were locals because we'd definitely make this a regular spot.",
            "Great little breakfast spot I come to all the time! I haven't been here for lunch or dinner, but I always enjoy my breakfast--no matter what I order! The staff is incredibly friendly and always provide quick service. Stop by if you're in the neighborhood",
            "We found this place on Yelp after watching \"Little Saigon\". This place had great reviews so why not check It out?We came here on an early Saturday evening and it was not too busy. It's a small cozy restaurant and seemed like there were many regular customers. The server was friendly and immediately greeted us as we walked in.I was indecisive on what to order and the server recommended the Crispy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. My friend ordered the Bacon BBQ Cheeseburger. I ended up ordering the Crispy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.The food came out pretty quick and the Bacon BBQ Burger was an open face burger and the Crispy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was an open face sandwich. I tried the burger and it was nice and juicy. The crispy sandwich was nice and crispy and was delicious. The food and service was definitely great here! I would definitely come back here when I am in the area.",
            "My fiancé and I drove in to San Francisco this morning in hopes of finding some great food paired with a festive ambiance. Today is Thanksgiving day. I searched Groupon and Google.com for a brunch spit that had rave reviews. The first thing to come up was Brenda's French soul food. We drove by that establishment and the line was practically around the corner! I hopped on Yelp to find other restaurants in the area and The New Spot on Yelp has amazing reviews, inviting food photos posted by previous guests and I had the option to hold my spot in line via yelp. We arrived at the time yelp suggested and was promptly greeted by a gentleman standing outside of the restaurant. I told him I had a reservation and he said \"you must be Cynthia\". The greeting was pleasant and the interactions genuine. We were seated immediately. For drinks we ordered a pair of Sangrias. The sangria's were tasty. We had a tough time making a decision on what to actually order because the choices were all good. I asked my waitress Louann for a recommendation and she recommended the chicken fried steaks. She must be a mind reader because that's exactly what I was leaning towards. The food came out in about 10 minutes and it was THE BOMB! I ordered my gravy on the side and also asked for a side of grilled onions. I don't know if I was just hungry or the food was that spectacular but that along with the amazing customer service compels me to rate this cute brunch spot a 6/5 or a 11 out of 10. Yup, it was that good!",
            "Finally tried out this place! It looks really cute on the outside and not as cute on the inside but still nice.I got the combo which was one of the more expensive things on the menu and a bit disappointed cuz it was pretty small: French toast, 2 eggs and one sausage. But everything tasted yummy and the meal was still cheap compared to Sf prices but i wish my dish was bigger.Service was good. And although it was busy, they told us to stay as long as we want which I thought was cute. They also refilled my coffee fast! I am overall very pleased.",
            "Found this spot on yelp and was excited to try. It definitely exceeded my expectations. Customer service was friendly and attentive. The food didn't take too long and it was amazing.  Definitely recommend!",
            "Best breakfast spot in town! My boyfriend and I come here all the time and we absolutely love it. The service is top notch and the food is incredible. My personal favorite is the keep it veggie scramble with a freshly squeezed orange juice on the side. The Eggs Benedict is great too. The owner is the nicest guy and really makes sure you feel at home when you come to the restaurant. Thank you!",
            "The service here is great! I love the fact that it has yelp's waitlist. Since my friend and I were rushing to get back to work on time from lunch break, the man at the door tried to get us seated as quickly as possible and had a waitress wait on us immediately. I think he might've been the owner, but it really showed that he cared about his customers. I had the country fried chicken. I actually really enjoyed it! It came out nice and crispy. I was afraid they'd give too little gravy, but it was just the right amount. Their house potatoes are really good too. I love it when there's peel left on, just to keep textures interesting. The biscuit wasn't as amazing as the rest of the meal, but I think that's acceptable; I don't think it was house-made. Definitely give this place a try! Perfect for brunch.",
            "This place has phenomenal food, even better service, and a convenient location on the corner of Polk & Union. I highly recommend this Russian Hill neighborhood gem!!"

            "We saw this place on California live so we had to check out the artichoke soup for ourselves. The previous review said the soup was bland, but I disagree. I thought the soup was very good and you could definitely taste the artichoke in it.It was piping hot on a rainy day. Really hit the spotMy hubby had the French dipHe really enjoyed it..",
            "This restaurant in Pescadero is known for its pies and artichoke goodness, and I completely get it. We came on a gloomy, cloud-covered day, and the creamy artichoke soup seriously hit the spot. In fact, I still dream about it.Our original plan was to get the artichoke bread from Arcangeli bakery and get the soup to go from Duarte's but they don't do to go orders - that's how popular it is. So, we decided to stay and I'm so glad we did, because their other specialty is the Ollaliberry pie. Definitely get it a la mode. The berries are a little sour but the ice cream is just sweet enough to balance it all out.The menu has the restaurant's history written on it, describing how it's been family owned and operated for four generations and how it became famous for the pies and artichoke dishes.Service was really quick and efficient despite being pretty busy. Our waitress was super friendly and explained to us what ollaliberries actually are - a cross between loganberries and youngberries (which are hybrids of their own). Anyway, Duarte's should definitely be on your list if you're making a stop in Pescadero.",
            "Food: 2/5     Price: 3/5      Service: 2/5        Ambience: 3/5A 4 generation tavern since 1894 in Pescadero, 45 miles south of San Francisco. Today, Duarte's vegetable garden is just behind the restaurant. The three full-time gardeners grow Ron Duarte's pick of artichokes, onions and leeks, many kinds of beans and peas, lettuce and squash, chard, fennel, herbs, olallieberries and strawberries. The restaurant's artichoke soup is so popular that the garden simply feeds their own family with artichokes; hundreds arrive at least twice a week from two other local family growers.The bar was the highlight. Sitting at a 100-year-old seat in a dim small room was an experience. Service was very slow and bad, no one refilled our drinks, and we were continually rushed to leave so others can sit down.Cream of artichoke & green chili ($11.50) - 2/5. their classic, overhyped. The soup was rich and thick, to be paired with their house sourdough(tough). Was a mediocre soup in my opinion.Deep fried smelt appetizer ($9.50) - 3/5. decently sized appetizer, nice crisp to the smelt, pairs well with tartar sauce and salsa.",
            "Yumm food and great service. This place has been around for a very long time( opened in 1864 I think )and family owned. Love the architectural details of the building ( restaurant) interior and exterior. I tried something I hardly ever see on the menu which is fried oyster sandwich. Fried oysters tasted really good but wished they give you more. Either the portion was a bit too small or I was just starving But the food was good. Tasted fresh and nicely seasoned . Comes with fries , they were fresh and crispy. Because we didn't want to wait half an hour for a table, we sat at the counter with no wait. I liked sitting at the counter , got to watch the cooking in actions and all of the delicious looking dishes coming out of the kitchen. I thoroughly enjoyed this dining experience and it was worth the drive from our campground ( Costanoa). Not too far from pescadero state beach.",
            "I enjoy eating in the bar more than in the main restaurant. The bar is a great option when there's a wait as sometimes you can grab a seat there with no wait at all!",
            "Our first day on our California vacation was rainy and dreary.  It was a perfect day for the ambience of Duarte's Tavern which feels like you are stepping back in time a bit.  The wait was about 40 minutes so we wandered around the town for a bit.  Once we were seated, our service was prompt.  My husband and I split an abalone sandwich and a bowl of the infamous artichoke soup.  I've never had abalone before and was surprised by how tender it was.  This version is lightly pan fried and then served on white bread with tarter sauce on the side.  It speaks to the notion that simple and clean flavors that are made with fresh ingredients will always win.  The artichoke soup was delicious and hit the spot with the rainy day.",
            "Considering there is no where else in town to go, it's pretty decent! Expensive for what you get, but they gotta make a living! My lobster ravioli was fine, a bit sparse for $30, but quite tasty, although a bit too al dente? The artichoke appetizer was a bit underwhelming- just steamed artichokes and an \"aioli\" sauce that tasted like ranch.  I tried some of the cioppino- a good heaping of crab and seafood- so worth your money, but the broth was a bit bland for me. Service was decent. Overall- not bad considering it's the only restaurant in town.",
            "First time back since last April. Found ololaberry pie and artichoke soup to be superb. Halibut fish & chips and pasta and artichoke hearts very nice. Service by Maricela was attentive and appreciated. Discovered that they will not fill takeout orders of artichoke soup, so we took out the green sauce soup, which was a good intro to it.Enjoy!",
            "Half / half cream of artichoke / green chile: This soup is great. It's not fancy, just cream with a noticeable green chili flavor and a subtle hint of artichoke. Even so, however, it tastes really good and goes amazing with the bread that they give you.Shrimp and Grilled cheese sandwich: This was also pretty standard, but I can't say I didn't like it. They used little shrimp and standard cheddar cheese.",
            "Duarte's is awesome!  You come for the artichoke soup or the green chili soup--have a bowl combining get the two in a ying-yang design and be sure to stay for the ollallieberry pie--scrumptious!!!We drive 3 hours just for the soup and pie at least twice per year.",
            "It's been there long before I was born, and I'm sure it'll be there long after I'm gone!I have been going to Duarte's since my Dad took me there when I was 8 years old. Their pies are unrivaled in the area, as is the artichoke soup.I love sitting at the bar and having a late lunch and a beer. My go-to is the crab melt sandwich. So GOOD!If you're in the area, be sure to stop in and rub elbows with the cool locals. Every aspect of this place is perfect!",
            "Pros: The half green chili, half artichoke soup was amazing! If I were to order only one, I'd pick green chili soup over the artichoke soup. The warm sourdough bread loaf with butter was the best free bread I've had at any restaurant. Freshly baked hot and soft on inside, crunchy on outside. The dessert portions are large.Cons: The crab sandwiches seems expensive at $20 for being only average sized & not coming with any sides but it tasted good. The strawberry-rhubarb pie is disgusting to look at cause it resembles reddish mushy intestines and it tasted really sour and unpleasant. The peach pie definitely had canned super sweet peaches in it. The bread pudding with vanilla sauce was better than both pies we tried but was also mediocre.",
            "This is a hard one. Their cream soup is really quite good. I like the green chili better than the artichoke but they were both really good and also are very good when mixed together. Which is a way that you can order them. The bread that came with it was also good.The only other thing we got was calamari, but we weren't impressed with that. It wasn't bad, but there was very little of it and I expected more and higher quality for the price.From looking at the menu and reading others reviews I do think it is overpriced. Not a bad restaurant by any means but probably not quite of the quality that those prices merit. Worth going when you're down there, because it's an institution, but don't get too excited about anything other than soup.",
            "It's not a trip to the beach without dinner at Duarte's !! From the looks of this old place you'd never realize they literally have the best cioppino in the world. The bar is like out of a movie - dark wood, little nooks , and the curly haired guy makes the best drinks around . I recommend the old fashioned or Manhattan- also great beers on tap .Our server Sean was incredible . He was so accommodating to our large party with little kids . He was so patient and fun . Aside from the cioppino ,Our fav meals here are the seafood pasta, steak, lobster raviolis, calamari steak sandwich, & the fresh raw oysters. I Love love love everything about this place .",
            "You guys.  I really don't get it.Over a thousand reviews, most of them singing great praises about the beloved Duarte's Tavern.  But I really don't get it.Mostly all the reviews mention the Half and Half Soup-- Cream of Artichoke and Cream of Green Chile, and the intriguing Olallieberry Pie.  Both of which were absolutely delicious.  But everything else really really fell short for me.DT is like nothing I have ever seen before.  The interior is reminiscent of your grandma's dining room, very homey and comforting.  Lots of wooden dining room tables and chairs from an era long passed.  And the menu features many comfort foods and classic dinner fare.  However the pricing was outrageous.  $21.50 for pork chops that were paper thin and flavorless served with what tasted like packaged mashed potatoes and canned gravy.  $5 for a kid's bowl of plain butter pasta.  An extra $4 for a side of fries.  My family of 4 spent near $100 for a dinner that was less satisfying than drive thru fast food.Definitely stop by DT when in the area.  Just to say you did.  But don't even bother looking at the menu.  Stick to what they are known for-- $11 bowl of half and half soup served with delicious piping hot bread and a $9 slice of tart Olallieberry Pie ala mode.The best things on the menu, and the only items worth your time and money.",
            "It's been several years since we have been to Duarte's Tavern, so we decided that it was time to try it again.   We arrived around 2pm yesterday, the Saturday of Labor Day Weekend.  Pescadero was crowded!  The line at Duartes was long with people waiting inside and outside.  We put in our name for a table for two and were told it would be about an hour and a quarter wait. So, we wandered around Pescadero, checking out the locally made furniture and the art gallery, so the time passed reasonably quickly.  We got some goat cheese at the nearby Harley Farms Goat Dairy and then went to the Archangeli Grocery for for fantastic freshly baked bread.  Our first lunch was a picnic of bread and cheese in the picnic area behind the grocery next to Pescadero Creek. We then returned to Duarte's for our second lunch (just like Hobbits!). Since we already feasted in our picnic, we only ordered soup, an appetizer and dessert. Hot bread and butter is served right after your order is taken.  It was a very good bread. The signature Artichoke Soup ($11.50/bowl) is tasty, but not extraordinary.  The price seems a bit high for an medium sized bowl of soup; but there was a sign at the check-in counter that said they were not serving the Artichoke Soup to-go, since there was a shortage of artichokes. So perhaps the price reflects a shortage in the key ingredient. (Regardless, the price seemed high for what you get). We also had an appetizer of Fried Oysters ($12 for a plate with 5 oysters).  The outsides were crisply fried, and the insides were tender, juicy, and delicious!  This is a good dish, which I recommend. For dessert, we had the Olallieberry cobbler a-la-mode ($9.50).  The Olallieberry cobbler without the ice cream is very tart, but with the ice cream mixed in, it was a creamy, very flavorful desert.",
            "$25 for my abalone sandwich and French fries.  It was a small sandwich , maybe about 3 Oz of Abalone breaded and fried with some sauce.",
            "A friend and I came in for lunch. We were seated near the bathrooms and kitchen; horrible location for a table. We were hungry, so we stayed. We ordered:1. Calamari: shared it. Neither of us liked it. 2 Artichoke soup: Tried it and it was just okay. I wouldn't order it again3. Clam chowder: it was good4. Desserts: my friend had the ollaberry pie with ice cream. She loved it. I ate the chocolate (mousse or cream, don't remember what it was called) pie. It was amazing. Giving this place 4 stars for the pie. If come back to try something else.",
            "The artichoke soup is the real deal, I repeat, the hype is justified and you should have yourself a bowl of this delicious, creamy, home style ode to artichoke and all of its deliciousness. No it didn't have to be fried and slathered in sauce, or charbroiled and doused in lemon and spices. It is the taste of artichoke melted into a creamy delectable hearty soup that will make you smile before the spoon even hits your lips. Don't forget the sourdough bread sidekick that is crunchy and fluffy and perfect dipping weapon. It was absolutely necessary in order to fully enjoy the soup.This is simple food at its finest, and that's why it gets such a high rating. Well, that and the very nice hostess that found us seats in half the time we were quoted (this place is very busy) Server was prompt, courteous and friendly. Place is charming and quaint, in a lively way. Seems like a historic little eatery with lots of tradition. I would want to come back to try the rest of the soups. Calamari was the downfall for them as I was ready to award a 5 star rating. They serve a small portion, perhaps among the smallest I've been served (even at the most dainty places which this is certainly not) but that wasn't the problem necessarily, the issue is that the  calamari is just not that great. The coating is too heavy causing them to have to overfry them, resulting in calamari that is a bit tougher than I'd want (you get about 9 smallish pieces for $10) skip that and eat more SOUP! Price is not an amazing deal but maybe it's just the area, it wasn't a deal breaker. Overall I'm happy I stopped by-4 artichoke soups, calamari, 2 beers and a lemonade was $77 before tip, not bad.",
            "I have been a big fan for couple decades. Father and son operation,  I'm sure uncles and cousins are in the mix. Absolute delight. From the crabs to oysters and the pies. You have to come and see for yourself Oh yeah, dont forget to visit the saloon!   Mlm"

            "Legit small general store with that charming country feel.  For a country store, it is pretty clean and somewhat upscale.  If you are comfortable at Whole Foods, you will most definitely be comfortable here.  And the opposite will yield the same, if you dislike Whole Foods, you will not get this place.Camping down the way, we started to get low on some supplies.  We were able to get everything we needed plus nice materials to make sandwiches for our later hike.  Everything will be a tad more expensive, but this isn't your suburban grocery store.  And most things are upped a notch as the pre-sliced deli meat are above Oscar Meyer level.The main star we found out whilst here is their Artichoke Bread.  It seems to be baked either here or super close, so it is pretty darn fresh.  I didn't get anything warm, but the freshness was still more than apparent.  They also do many different variations, some with garlic, some with basil pesto while others are half baked, meant to be put in another oven for ultimate appeal.We chose a Pesto Artichoke Bread, to go with some Peppered Turkey and some creamy Muenster cheese.  Legit.  The bread we chose was flat-ish, much like focaccia.  But it had a tad more structure than basic focaccia dough.  The artichoke wasn't super present, as you might get one bite per small sandwich.  But the baked-on pesto and cheese surface definitely takes the experience up a few levels.  My first time having this bread, and I'm sold and will utilize it again.It's in a very small town, maybe a half street worth of businesses.  I came during a slower time of year (winter) and it was already showing signs of bustle.  I can't imagine how the population will mob here when the weather is super nice or a long weekend.  The spacing will just not add up.  I don't think I want to find out.  But still coming back, just not with the mob.",
            "If you're anywhere near Pescadero, this is a must stop. Get to Arcangeli's as soon as you can and grab a loaf (or two!) of the artichoke bread. Hurry, because it goes fast! It's so soft and has large chunks of real artichokes baked in. I could probably eat the entire loaf in one sitting, if we're being completely honest. I promise you, it won't disappoint.The bakery is located right on the main street in town. It tends to be crowded and lines are long, since everyone comes for the artichoke bread. They have plenty of other options too though, if artichokes aren't your thing. Garlic cheese bread, focaccia, the list goes on.I suggest coming early for the bread, picking up some fresh goat cheese at Harley Farms, and going for an oceanside picnic.",
            "This town is two miles off if Hwy 1. It is a place that should be visited if you are on Hwy 1. This store has some amazing sandwiches. We had The Godfather. It has some superb flavors. We also bought some if the Garlic Cheese n Artichoke bread to try later. I will post the verdict later. This Place Rocks",
            "I come to Pescadero for one thing only, and it's not the beach. It's the artichoke bread! This place is notorious for their freshly baked artichoke bread!!!!! It is SO delicious and straight out of the oven. If you come at the right time the bread is still hot in your hands. I always get Havarti cheese from their cheese selection to pair with it. So so so good. This place is definitely a necessity for any Tourist who wants to experience true local Northern California goodness!",
            "4 years.4 years I've waited and bided time for \"the next time I'm in Santa Cruz\", which is apparently never.But finally, it's happened! I had the awesome experience of stopping in Norm's market on the way up back from a short trip in Santa Cruz. Upon walking in, you'll smell the unmistakable aromas of Italian spices and bread. They have a great little selection of wines and a more impressive lot of tapanades, sauces, and spreads - so explore a bit.We ended just picking up two fresh warm loaves of their famed garlic artichoke round. The pies also looked good but unfortunately, I'm the only pie lover in the family. Sigh.After buying, we couldn't resist so we cut a little piece for each of us, despite still being full from lunch. The bread has a remarkable garlic flavor imbued into it. But where I almost expected artichokes to pour out, I had a hard time finding any! There aren't nearly as many artichoke hearts in it anymore (or as older pictures show) - more than a little disappointing! Plus, our first loaf was super dense for bread - risen, fully baked, but very small tight air pockets inside. It made the loaf dry unless you had a little butter or olive oil to help. Our second loaf fared a bit better, less dense...but hardly an artichoke to be found! Not worth the near $7 price tag for bread roulette unfortunately.",
            "Don't believe the hype.Or, believe it if you want to - but at least read this review first.Coming to this bakery is an otherworldly experience. Tesla SUVs and porches line this tiny street in Pescadero, their owners hovering like vultures around the empty bread baskets. It's the most amazing scene I've ever seen. Oddly enough, despite the fact that this tiny market experiences a crushing crowd every weekend (as they informed me), they somehow don't make enough artichoke bread - the one thing everyone comes for. Imagine our surprise when we arrived at noon only to discover that they were sold out! Even more unappealing are the lines. We'd arrived hungry with 5 kids in tow planning to buy food for a picnic only to discover that it was a 40 minute wait for a sandwich. - - No, don't read that again, you read it right the first time. But you're stuck once you're here, because there's nothing else in Pescadero. So we watched as the busy, overworked staff in the back tried to accommodate all the lunch orders. There's no space behind the counter, they're understaffed, they don't have an assembly line...it's total chaos. We waited in that line for so long that we were able to devise at least four different strategies for speeding up the process. (Why hasn't the management done the same? You have an insane amount of business, you could get so many more customers in and out the door if you created a better system.) Turns out the management isn't interested in any suggestions, which we know because we asked. Meanwhile, 3 babies were crying in line because the wait was so long and people were leaving the store as soon as they saw the line (see pics). Woo.So much for a peaceful Sunday lunch. Listen up y'all - I love small businesses and support local businesses, but when a place becomes this popular, perhaps it's time for me to get my sandwiches (and artichokes) elsewhere....?",
            "What a find! We stopped in downtown Pescadero on a Friday afternoon to have lunch before heading to Butano State Park, and ran across this market. Omg their Artichoke Garlic Herb Bread is amazing! They had a fresh and hot out of the oven Artichoke bread when we were there, so we got one. We should have eaten it right then and there, but we were totally full from our lunch at Duarte's Tavern. We took it to our campsite, and sliced it the next day, and made a sandwich out of it for our lunch. The bread had chunks of artichoke and garlic inside the loaf. It was so good! We also served the leftover bread with the Artichoke Spinach Dip and Edamame Hummus Dip my friend Joan bought from here as well, and we enjoyed them tremendously.We actually came back here on Sat afternoon after a hike, as we wanted to get more fresh bread and dips. We did the right thing and, ate and shared a warm loaf between the three of us right then and there. We also walked down to Sante Arcangeli Winery Tasting Room (same owners as Norm's Market), and ate our bread during wine tasting. So perfect together! :)If you're needing food and supplies for camping, this is a good stop too. We bought a Duraflame to supplement our firewood and a massive Butterscotch cookie to share with our friends. I would totally come back here for more of their bread next time we're in the area!",
            "Great little market. Small and very manageable, not a large selection  but everything you need; food items as well as toiletries. Two things that stood out: the deli section and the bakery section. From the deli I got a grilled cheese made on their homemade bread with a side salad of marinated artichoke and mushrooms...excellent. From the bakery I got an olallieberry scone cause I'd never heard of olallieberries...also excellent. Nice little seating area outside the market.",
            "Every 15 -20 min they pull out their famous artichoke garlic bread... piping hot... so good!!! They have half cooked to go as well but nothing better then getting it hot out of their oven",
            "Great artichoke and herb sourdough! Definitely a place to stop for a nice sandwich or cheese and beer/wine! I strongly recommend.",
            "Despite having driven along the 1 a number of times, it was only recently I stopped by and tried their famous bread.It was ~445PM on a weekend so we weren't expecting anything, just check it out and stretch our legs after a long drive in the mountains. Lucky for us, a fresh batch of their Artichoke Garlic Herb and Sourdough Garlic Herb had been put out - warm and fragrant. The former is their most famous so we went with that, but I'd get the other next time. We didn't care for the whole artichoke hearts in the center of the bread. If they were marinated in pesto or garlic they would've been better. The bread itself was great though.Definitely worth stopping by for a bite. Maybe we'll also get around to trying the Godfather Sandwich, and the Cinnamon English Muffins which looked delicious.",
            "Saturday we decided to cruise the coast. Became a bit hungry and decided to stop off in Pescadero for a bite to eat. Stopped first at Duarte's tavern but the wait was over 40min for 2 people. Walked a bit further down the street and found this great little grocery store with a sandwich shop in the back, and some amazing artichoke garlic bread. At the market we bought fresh artichoke garlic bread that they were bringing out every few minutes it seemed, along with anything else you could need on a hwy 1 drive (drinks, snacks, etc.) We also bought a caprese and godfather sandwich. They also had build your own sandwiches for the picky consumer. They had some seating outside, central to the downtown strip. The sandwiches were amazing! And we were able to take our lunch down to the beach to eat, for the perfect setting. Will definitely return for sandwiches and more artichoke garlic bread!",
            "Fantastic, freshly baked, HOT from the oven, heavenly bread!  Wow!My wife and I were in Pescadero yesterday, after driving delightfully through narrow, twisty, beautiful, forested, one+ lane roads (that are two way) through the mountains.  After getting some fresh goat cheese at the nearby Harley Farms Goat Dairy, we went to the Arcangeli Grocery (also known as Norm's Market) for some bread for our cheese. The grocery was very crowded, for good reason.  Their freshly baked bread, steaming hot, right from the oven, is absolutely delicious.  We got two loaves: Artichoke ($6.49/loaf) and Garlic Herb ($5.49/loaf). The hot bread was so tempting, we started eating it while waiting in the somewhat long (but worth it) line to the cash register.  In the back, behind the grocery, there is a park with picnic tables next to Pescadero Creek.  This is a nice setting to enjoy your food. We put our Goat Cheese on the bread and had a delicious meal.The Artichoke Bread had many many whole artichoke hearts baked inside.  The flavor of the Garlic Herb bread was subtle and heavenly.  I highly recommend this.",
            "I'm calling my favorite bakery the day before, \"Hi!  It's me, again~I'd like ordering seven, half-baked, artichoke loaves and I'd like picking them up tomorrow afternoon.  May I please place my order?\" Sure as the sun sets and the sun rises, the order I placed calling long distance-I live four hours away from Pescadero, mind you . . . All seven, half-baked, artichoke loaves were HOT, wrapped, and ready upon arriving at the bakery:  SCHWEET!!!!!Oh~I couldn't resist buying two, fully baked, artichoke loaves so, I can inhale them one right after the other-devouring it~schmearing, smothering the hand-size portion of artichoke bread with Harley goat cheese ---YUMMY~!Hey, hey, hey~I'm going to place another order before Christmas and make another ROAD WARRIOR, artichoke bread run---Zoooooooom!",
            "Nice sandwich shop in Pescadero town. I think I need to explore the area a bit more next time. The sandwiches were huge. They had bread, pies and cheese and other misc items to pick up before hitting the beaches.It's not too far out of hwy 1",
            "So I didn't actually go to the market but my boss was in Pescadero today and they brought back Artichoke Garlic Herb bread for our team to share!  This was my first time trying the bread and I was surprised at how there were such large chunks of artichoke inside!!  Never seen bread like that before...  The bread not only looks good but is delicious too!!  It is soft on the inside and has a nice crust on the outside. Definitely wanna check out the market myself and buy some of the famous Artichoke Garlic Herb bread for friends/family!  I'm guessing this will be a must-stop for me whenever I go to Pescadero in the future.",
            "Have you ever tried going to a restaurant, but found out it was closed due to a holiday? It's probably because of my poor sense of time, but for me this happens at least once every freaking year. DARN YOU HOLIDAYS! Exactly 4 months into 2018, I relived this same experience with my girlfriend. After a fun adventure at Ano Nuevo State Park, we were hoping to grab some delicious food at Duarte's Tavern (aka the one place to eat at in the lovely town of Pescadero, California). Unfortunately, it was closed for Easter! DARN YOU HOLIDAYS! And nope, it wasn't a good old April Fool's joke. Luckily for us though, there was one spot still serving food in this quaint little town: Arcangeli Grocery Co - Norm's Market. In the past, most of my backup restaurants have turned out bleh (yelp.com/biz/sushi-sio-f…). But this time, Arcangeli was bomb dot com!!!As the name suggests, Arcangeli was pretty much a small market in the heart of Pescadero that included both a deli and a tiny bakery. Arcangeli had virtually all the bare essentials one would need to survive such as toiletries, canned food, and meat. But, since this place was in the middle of nowhere (relatively speaking), you're guaranteed to pay a premium for things you could easily find at a Safeway or a Target. However, that's all beside the point. My girlfriend and I were here for dem sandwiches! Speaking of (sand)which, at the deli section there were 4 types of specialty options - each one delectable in their own way. The one that caught my eye was The Godfather cause damn, I love me some garlic-herb. For those of y'all who want to customize, Arcangeli offered a wide variety of items to choose from. With at least 6 types of meat, bread, cheese, and condiments, you're looking at over 1,000 different combinations! If you want to spice it up further, the deli also served some Artichoke Soup too. When it came to price, the sandwiches here seemed fairly affordable. Unless you added on extra ingredients, specialties went from $8.75-$9.5 and custom options were priced at $7.95 (including tax). Furthermore, a 12 oz. bowl of soup as well as half-sandwiches were $5 each. This actually didn't seem that bad considering the lack of food options around Pescadero.I ended up getting The Godfather and my girlfriend ordered the Pesto Chicken. Here's what we thought of the experience:-- DELICIOUS FOOD, BUT SMALL PORTIONS --Let's start with my Godfather. I'm not sure if it's because I was famished, or maybe I just latched onto the hype surrounding Arcangeli, but holy cow I enjoyed my sandwich a bunch! The meat was savory, the vegetables were super fresh, and I couldn't help but fall in love with the gooey provolone cheese. The best part was probably the pesto foccacia bread. Not overly crispy, and packed with flavor. MMM MMM GOOD. On my girlfriend's end, she pretty much echoed the same thoughts about her Pesto Chicken. It definitely tasted good, and oh man the chicken was SO JUICY! The biggest downer for both my girlfriend and me, however, was the serving size. As you can see from pictures on Yelp, the sandwiches were only slightly bigger than the ones your mom probably used to pack for you when you were younger. Our sandwiches were also quite flat too, so it wasn't like they pressed ingredients together. Not to take away from the deliciousness of our meal, but we were definitely still hungry afterwards. For $9.5, you'd be getting a great but small sandwich. -- FRIENDLY, EFFICIENT STAFF --From our minimal encounter with the employees at Arcangeli, I thought they were very kind and courteous. But, what made us super impressed was their speed. Despite the fact that this place attracted hella customers (probs most came here from Duarte's), we got our food ~5-10 minutes after ordering!-- GREAT OUTDOOR SEATING -- We didn't notice it at first, but there was actually backyard seating behind the grocery market! Several tables sat along the grass in the shade, and there was even a porta potty/wash area. Better than eating in your car for sure!I've hinted to this multiple times above, but perhaps one of the best features about Arcangeli was the location. You see, the thing about Pescadero is there really aren't a lot of food options in this town. So if you find yourself wandering around the Pescadero area, this might be your only - and most convenient - saving grace. It's close by to the coast/Highway 1 and there's plenty of street parking too!All in all, I'd definitely recommend Arcangeli Grocery Co - Norm's Market to everyone who wants a bite in Pescadero. The sandwiches are tasty, food comes out fast, and there's lots of seating! The only real drawback of this place that y'all will have to be aware of is definitely the portion sizes. Other than that, I give the deli inside this market a \"Nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating. If you check this place out, I hope you find it as enjoyable as I!Meat well and prosper,",
            "Friends and I were prepping for a picnic by the beach and needed to pick up some bread and a friend knew exactly where to go, so off to Norms we went!This market smells amazing, so many fresh loafs of bread to choose from, and some are ready to eat and some you can take home and finish baking there. Some sourdough, some French, just some amazing breads to choose from.They also have a nice selection of meats, cheese, pesto, hot sauces, pies, fresh pastries, and more. You can also go to the deli and order yourself a sandwich too.We settled on a garlic sourdough and picked up some parmesan asiago spread. Kind of sad I didn't grab some bake at home loafs of bread. Such good bread! If in the area, go check them out!",
            "If you are ever driving down the 1 and see a sign for Pescadero, immediately direct your GPS to Arcangeli's for their to-die-for garlic artichoke bread. I'm officially watching my carbs intake unless I am within a 20-mile radius of this place and can easily take down an entire loaf by myself. Even out in the middle of nowhere the demand is so high for this bread that they are constantly baking batches all day so if you are around for 10 or 15 minutes you'll be able to snag a fresh hot loaf which you can enjoy in their seating area out back or at one of the nearby beaches (both great options). They also have other pastries in their store as well as a sandwich spot that always seems to have a long line. Pro tip: take one of their half-baked loaves to go - you can bake it at home and have a fresh loaf to enjoy later (maybe even later that same evening if you are feeling ambitious).",
            "I can't review on their delicious looking pies or sandwiches.  I can say they looked bomb and the folks ordering them looked excited.  But I stumbled across here and decided to buy two of their garlic artichoke bread based on other reviews.Man I'm glad I got it.  It was delicious!  Super addictive.I took the second one to a party and it was a hit.  I felt like a superstar.Buy that bread and be a superstar."

            "First things first. Parking is valet only and at a premium. For guests staying overnight, parking is a whopping $49 a day. During weekdays, parking is $25 and i don't believe there is a discount for dining in...at least I didn't get one.Anyway, my review and rating is on the food, ambiance and service....and all three are impeccable. Gerald, the manager at the Conservatory area is a consummate professional and made me feel like the most important person in the room. This kind of service is a dying trait, especially in the Bay Area where service has become horrible in general.Navio features a menu of raw selections -- oysters, sashimi and fat, poached gulf shrimp, to name a few -- but the aforementioned spaghetti chitarra proved too tempting to pass up, as did the special one night of Maryland soft shell crab. There are non-seafood options including duck (awesome), a 14-ounce ribeye and a 10-ounce filet mignon with an incredible texture. Ordered medium rare, the filet was perfectly pink and served atop two crisp potato cakes.A must try for a special occasion!",
            "If you're into paying 300+ dollars for a brunch for two where you have to stand in VERY long lines that don't  ever let up, this is right up your alley. We were also seated in a hallway where they had all the tables squished next to each other to add even more mismatched tables and chairs  they must have found in the back, cause you know, what they really need is more people in line. Aside from the view, there's nothing noteworthy.  This did not feel like \"the Ritz\" at all. Ps. We went for Sunday brunch this past weekend. The caviar is bottom of the barrel. Good luck!",
            "Do you have money to blow? Do you like caviar?If yes to the above questions, then this brunch is for you -- the Ritz way (but alcohol not included, *shocked* considering it's ~$150/person). The star of this buffet brunch is their (unlimited) caviar featuring 5 kinds! Other foods also include oysters, seafood, sushi, prime rib, dimsum, breakfast foods, charcuterie/etc. However, I would say the selection is quite limited (i.e. they only have 1 soup selection) and the food didn't totally blow me away. But cute and extensive dessert station!Beautiful views. Exceptional Service. Thank you to my kind boyfriend's parents for this treat :')",
            "Came here with my family (7 people total) for Sunday brunch with unlimited oysters and caviar. Service was excellent. View was amazing. Tables were huge and place was spacious. Quality of the food was great. However, for the price tag, $129 for adults and $64 for children, I wish there was a larger variety. Food options consisted of: bread and charcuterie, American breakfast (eggs, bacon, sausages), dim sum, sushi, carving station (beef and lamb), raw bar, and dessert station. It would be nice if the meal came with a nice glass of bubbly. Great place to treat yourself and your loved ones. P.S. Valet parking is $40.",
            "Came here with a group related event. I had the following:Appetizer:*Ahi Tuna Ribbons - delicious and I'm not a huge fan of sashimi either. The plate is beautifully decorated and you're suppose to mix all the decorations on the plate with the fish before eating. *Spaghetti Chitarra - delicious as well. The chunks of crab are delicious. The spaghetti was a little too buttery for me though. Entree:*Diver Scallops - absolute delicious. The scallops were cooked perfectly. They were on the salty side however. The mashed potatoes and the gravy were delicious as well.*Dry Aged Ribeye - honestly, it was good but still felt ordinary..like I could have had this easily at another restaurant. The meat was a little tough/chewy, maybe that's just because of the cut. Dessert (Not the full names):*Chocolate Rock - really awesome, especially if you like chocolate cake.  The mirror glaze was beautiful as well.*Fig Mousse - this was okay.  New, intenteresting, and the flavors were okay. Tl;Dr:  it's good.  I would recommend it.  The steak was ordinary to me but the scallops were awesome.",
            "The Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay is a fantastic place to spend some time if you're up for breathtaking views and being pampered.  It all comes at a price, so bring your wallet.  Anchored by a oceanfront golf course it offers all the stuff you would expect and a few pleasant surprises.  Excellent golf, check.  Bagpiper playing to the gallery in the fog, awesome.  Strolls along the coastline, fantastic.  Times in the outdoor terrace, fun.  Drinks and food in the lobby conservatory bar, swanky.  Spa, go ahead if you like.Did I forget to mention haute cuisine?  Well, there's Navio, their fancy pants dining venue.  These kinds of places are necessary because we have occasions where we need to go somewhere-where long pants are required with tucked in shirts and we can't pronounce half of the menu, don't know many of the ingredients, but try to get by acting like we do.  No?  Just me?  Sorry, I'm lacking the culture gene I suppose.  I wouldn't come here unless I had to, and I did, but I wasn't paying, so I had that going for me, and that's nice.But in all seriousness, the view!  Edge of the world, contemplating all of existence kind of stuff happening here.  Possibly worth the cost of admission.  The service was fantastic, constant attention, menu items explained during ordering and upon delivery, pleasant banter making us all feel at ease and welcome.  We sat by the window.  Somebody in our party planned ahead and made this happen and you should too.  The menu is seafood forward, with some duck and a couple hunks of beef available for land lubbers.  I read some reviews going in and was looking forward to some melt-in-your-face-off short rib action, but alas, that was then, there weren't none now.  In addition to the typical appetizer-entree setup Navio offers a multi-course 2.5+ hour tasting menu extravaganza.  They recommend that all in your dining party partake if one does, because otherwise there are winners and losers, feelings get hurt, some watch others being very well fed, etc...  There's also an optional wine course to go with it.Our party was full of non-drinker, so no wine, but I ordered a manly Cask Manhattan.  It was meh.  Big block of ice, Buffalo Trace bourbon, a splash of sweet vermouth, a fancy cocktail cherry on a stick, a straw.  I do way better at home, but hey, it took the edge off.To start we shared a seafood platter and a foie gras torchon.  The seafood platter was fresh and tasty, full of the raw ocean's bounty.  The foie was disappointing, dusted in pistachio, with spruce and pickled rhubarb it really pushed the main ingredient to the back.  I also peeled a piece of plastic out of my mouth.  Forgivable, I'm over it.  The brioche they provided to accompany the foie received mixed reviews.  I thought it had an oily, donut-like aftertaste.For the main course I ordered the poached salmon.  This dish was German fine dining to the core:  fresh tasty piece of fish served on boiled cabbage, with chanterelle mushrooms, a few sprouty things and a delicious chamomile brown sauce, served with a side of spot-on spaetzle.Pretty good stuff.  They threw sea salt on everything.  My tongue was a little raw from it eventually but it was satisfying all the same.We passed on dessert, but we had a birthday person in our party so the thoughful waiter brought a few candies and cookies to enjoy and a candle to blow out.If you're going to do it big, keep Navio in mind.  It's pretty good.",
            "Most overpriced brunch I've ever been to and alcohol was not included! Honestly, for $200 pp, the food did not blow me away. Given that there was a caviar set-up and some oysters, everything else was not worth it. There was some dim-sum items, sushi and sashimi, charcuteries corner, breakfast, fresh fruits and dessert. The dessert was absolutely beautiful but was a hit or miss with them. I didn't go back for seconds, which should tell you it was just meh.Service was nice, but you obviously pay the ridiculous price tag because you're at the Ritz and want show off that you got the cash.",
            "Review for Sunday brunch.  One word: over-the-top-ridiculous-luxurious-insanely-expensive...It's an over the top, insanely good, but also insanely expensive brunch experience.  Yes it's more of an experience than just a brunch.  I think it's worth having once but at that price, you'll go broke too quickly.I won't go into detail because I'm sure many others have but it spans breakfast, to dim sum, to caviar, to hot foods, to salami and cheese, to salads, to crab claws and other seafood, to a huge dessert set up - the dessert was beautiful and also tasty.  Here's a few things they did not have: hot crab legs, lobster tails, steaks, mussels and clams, 24 karat gold, Dom, abalone, you know those things. Ha.Beautiful view of the probably normal fog layer, but yet it's still nice.  Strangely enough, the service is fairly down to earth and nice.  Fresh juices are really tasty and I think included.  Hard to tell when your bill is so high (when you add in Valet parking, it looks like they added on a Filet Mignon to your bill).I think Saturday brunch may include a bloody mary but not sure.NOTE: Valet parking on the weekend if $40 Plus gratuity.  If you're meeting people, I'd say try to meet outside the Ritz gate.  There's a small parking lot outside the Ritz gate, but probably an 8-10 min walk in.  Not a lot of other parking options but just be warned so you don't fall over when the guard says it's $40.  If you're up for a huge splurge, this is your place.  But you have to start saving money now.",
            "Great view and great food. Awesome service by Tyler. Very pleasant experience! Thank you!",
            "Here for the Sunday brunch. Everything I had was delicious. Lots of delectable vegetarian options. There are 250 items for the buffet so go on an empty stomach. Good luck trying to not overdo it. The cheese collection was nice. Don't be a caviar whore, try a bit and go back for more, I don't eat the stuff but it was funny seeing some people piling the stuff on their plate.It is a fun outing between SF and Santa Cruz.",
            "Probably best Sunday buffet in the Bay Area but also priciest.  Really delicious food, terrific service, and great atmosphere.Hint: avoid outrageous mandatory $40 valet parking fee by parking at corner of (1602) Miramontes Point & Cabrillo Highway and Uber in.",
            "AMAZING experience!!! I was a little concerned about dinner because I know the Ritz's wknd brunch is the rave. I am sooooo happy I decided to go ahead with my plans!!! Service was A+++. From the moment I walked in everyone called me by name, and did so for the rest of the evening. Our waiter Dean did a magnificent job. He is top notch at what he does!!! We even chatted a bit about the Bay Area. The experience far exceeded my expectations and now I'll have to return for the wknd brunch!!!",
            "Went to breakfast and the view. The service is expected from the Ritz Carlton, personal and efficient. The food was of high quality. We had the short ribs and eggs Benedict with crabs. Both dishes were tasty and really hit the spot.They were also able to accommodate a lunch menu item for breakfast (pumpkin soup).The view of the pacific and golf course were excellent and added to the ambience. The parking however was $20 and the coffee was $7/cup (steep coffee price even for a luxury hotel). Overall experience, food was great, views were excellent, and service on point. Lost a star due to the overall price/value for money. Total cost including parking was around $120 for breakfast for two people (no alcoholic beverages).",
            "Has got to be the best Sunday brunch I've ever had in my life. Thanks to my gf who I thought was crazy at the time for bringing me here. I thought it was a overpriced brunch place until we started to walk to our table. I noticed the food that were prepared by the counter and some on platters. They all looked fresh and well organized. As I walked pass the food counter I noticed they had fresh caviar, crab, scallops, and much much more and was told it was a all you can eat. Wow..... now this is worth it! So as we sat there and ate our food I looked around and noticed that the scenery is also very pleasant. It's a very nice quiet place. Bonus points for having designated waiters/waitresses per each table to assist you when ever you need a refill on coffee/drinks/utensils and so forth. They are there to accommodate you and provide great service. A++Overall the experience here was great! I came back here again to treat my gf and we couldn't get enough of their food. I would highly recommend  this place to any couples out there. This is one place you will remember where you had a good brunch.",
            "We celebrated our anniversary here at Navio. It was excellent and the service was exceptional. Donte and the other lady who I don't recall her name was our server and their attitude along with the quality of food was beyond average. Each and every option at the buffet was very unique but a slight improvement on the Chinese cuisine would be necessary. The texture on those potstickers was slightly thick on it's exterior and the flavoring on those Cantonese barbecue-pork-filled buns was slightly off from our expectation. Definitely coming back here soon!",
            "This is the 2nd time we came here for the Sunday buffet lunch! It is definitely a special treat for yourself after a stressful work week. It costs more than 100 after tax per person. What you are getting? It is unlimited caviar, oyster, and scrumptious desserts! I was blown away on my first trip to this place (fall 2017). I felt the service was top notch. I had waiters checking in with me every 10-15 mins. They made sure you are taken good care of. They always make sure they clean up the table when you are gone for the 2nd round. They offered me drinks in a way that make me feel drinks is also a buffet style.I am getting disappointed this time. The food is the same. You will still get unlimited caviars and oyster. They are at the same quality as compared to my last visit. However, I didn't feel as spoiled as last time. The waiters did not come check on you if you needed drinks. I remember the waiters last time was offering juice /tea in the beginning, asking again when we are in the middle, and she was thoughtful to offer another one as we close to finish (you know you need a soothing cup of tea to finish off this luxury meal). Anyway, the other thing that I am disappointed about is parking. You have to pay for $40 for valet. It is very unlikely you are going to spend 6-8 hours there including the buffet. I remember the parking was validated. I checked on the website. It did say the parking is only $15 if you dine at Navio. The hosts did say this policy just started. It will take me a while to come back again.",
            "I ended up going to Navio to celebrate a wedding, and had a four course meal in the process. Service was on point - they checked on us every few minutes, asking if we needed another drink or if we would like more bread.Food was solid too - the filet Mignon was fairly rare and was cooked well. The dessert was great too - the chocolate mousse was decadent and somewhat fruity as well.",
            "I came here with my friend since she had been raving about the Sunday brunch with unlimited caviar. Coming up to the Ritz, the hotel itself is beautiful. You can only get your car valeted, but if you're there for brunch they just add that cost onto your bill. Upon walking in, there was great service right from the start. Everyone working there was so great and always checking in on us and ready to clear away plates and give us fresh new utensils. We ordered some drinks to start, I ordered the pineapple mary which was pretty delicious. However, drinks here are expesnive and not included with the brunch price. As for the food, it was all incredibly delicious. You have your usual brunch things such as the Japanese sushi section, classic breakfast items (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage), there were unique little bites at different stands in the buffet. I can't even remember exactly everything I tried. I really liked the prime rib and the lamb that I tried. The lamb had a fabulous mint jelly to pair with. The caviar bar is something out of a dream. So many different kinds and multiple garnishes and bread/crackers to place it onto. There was also a lot of other raw items to choose from. Lastly to finish the meal, the dessert area was like walking into a candy shop. They had marbled chocolates, cakes, puddings, etc. I'm so sad that I forgot to go back for some gelato at the end. I guess I will have to wait for next time. Afterwards, we took a walk outside and looked into the ocean area. The outside area is really nice as well. All in all it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend it.",
            "I love the Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay and adored staying here but have to say my experience at Navio was very mixed. We had dinner here one night and then did the Sunday buffet brunch in the adjacent room. The dinner was very mediocre at maybe worthy of two stars at most. My friend and I shared several dishes and they were all very forgettable and in both of our opinions, not worth the RC prices that were attached to them. I was surprised for this caliber of a resort that the food wasn't better. Truthfully, the food in the club floor lounge was superior to what we had at Navio and we actually went there for dessert after being disappointed by our dessert at dinner. The brunch was a different story and really wonderful - more of a 4 star experience. Be warned that it really is a lunch buffet as the breakfast items are pretty slim. This wasn't a problem for me though as I was craving lunch anyways, and the buffet didn't disappoint with lots of yummy dim sum and hot dishes. The dessert area was also very impressive and a sugar addicts dream! It's unfortunate as there aren't that many options without driving off the resort but I'd avoid eating here unless it's for brunch.",
            "Thank you for the exceptional service at your restaurant! The food was great, the view was spectacular, the service was high. My birthday went super great! Thank you and we will definitely return!"

            "Eating at Barbara's Fishtrap is a tradition for my family whenever we're visiting the area. Over the years, we've figured a few things out about the place, like what to order, what to wear, what to bring, etc. What I will start off this review by telling you is that the Fishtrap serves some delicious food and it gets absolutely jam-packed during peak hours, so there may be a little bit of a wait. It will be worth it, if you prepare for it.Eat your staple comfort food seafood dishes here like clam chowder in a bread bowl, fish and chips, clam strips, fried calamari, and the like. These are the things that the Fishtrap does the best. The further you venture away from these items, the further you risk being jealous of everyone else in the restaurant who is eating delicious fried food.Dress WARMLY. As you will most likely experience a little bit of waiting, you should prepare to spend some wait time in the foyer (which is basically outside). Not only that, but you might actually be seated in the outside covered patio area. There are heat lamps, but you should still dress warmly because the cold and sea breeze from the outside can absolutely permeate the space.Bring cash, because the Fishtrap does not accept cards. There is an ATM inside but bringing cash ahead of time will make your life a lot easier. Also, to reiterate, please bring a coat. Please. You will feel better. Your wife will feel better. It's just a good idea.Every visit my family and I have had has concluded with us leaving full and happy, and as the years have gone on and we've lived and learned, less cold as we come better prepared each time. Enjoy! This little place gets crowded for a reason!",
            "Only came here to get clam chowder to go and oh boy was I glad ! The clam chowder was creamy and filled with tons of clams in every bite. The broth used was so flavorful. Didn't get a Chance to dine in.",
            "Found this on Yelp, Half Moon Bay, CA about 30 miles south of San Francisco.CASH ONLY  Expect a Wait, they close early at 8 pm...check hoursWas in the mood for fried calamari/and fish and chips. This spot came recommended by locals and also Yelp.  Dropped my phone in the local hotel toilet...yes, I know GROSS...so no pics with this one, phone was turned off and drying in the car after drying and sanitizing with 91% rubbing alcohol (which worked by the way).The calamari did not disappoint, although it did not look nearly as good as some of the photos, the pieces were much smaller and darker but the taste was there.  The fish and chips were OK, I much preferred the calamari, the chips were good. Coleslaw was average at best and sloppily piled on the plate next to the fried calamari with the chance for the calamari to get soggy...not impressed, if ordering again, I would get chips with the fried calamari. Loved the red dipping cocktail sauce for the calamari.We also ordered Clam Chowder which was average...and a basket of bread which we enjoyed.Service was slow and somewhat scattered/rough around the edges, no frills.We dined inside...lovely views of the ocean but small very casual dining room.",
            "We love this place! My son and ex-husband discovered it 40 years ago when they first moved to the area, and when I moved here 20 years ago (and on vacation) I've enjoyed their wonderful very fresh seafood! They are located right next to Pillar Point Harbor and the fishermen bring their freshest catches directly to Barbara's.Today we came over the hill a bit early, and I was able to get the one handicap parking spot in the lot across the street from the restaurant, which sits on stilts above the Pacific Ocean. When they opened the doors at 11 am we got a table (coming when they open helps a lot, otherwise you may have quite a wait). They do have a to-go window outside the restaurant and connected to it for those who want to eat on one of the picnic tables, or take it to their hotel room at the Oceano (just behind it) or the B&B across the street.This was part of my son's birthday celebration (the birthday was the previous month). He ordered the usual prawns tempura (you can get them by the piece a la carte, or as part of a meal with a side like fries, cole slaw or rice), and a bowl of their famous clam chowder, made without milk but very creamy. I had my usual scallops tempura (also a la carte, no sides, more room for the seafood), and a cup of the chowder.He got a \"big ol' bowl\" (quart) of the chowder to go (about the size of two huge bowls of chowder) and I got more scallops tempura to go (the breading is softer if you do this and heat them up later, but still just as tasty). I think the tartar sauce is house made on site. The waitstaff and the owner are friendly and helpful, and I usually see my favorite Jeanie but she wasn't there today. Hopefully next time.There are two very clean restrooms (used to be mens and womens, now both unisex).I highly recommend that you visit Barbara's Fishtrap, once you've done that you'll always return!P.S. I noticed a lot of reviews say \"cash only\" which is true, but they neglect to say that there is an ATM on the premises, so you don't have to worry about what to order - get what you love, and use that ATM.",
            "We love this place. My college friends and I make it a point to visit this restaurant any time we are in Half Moon Bay. Parking is close by and sometimes the wait time is a little crazy. If you don't want to wait too long, they do have a to go window that you can order from. You can take it close to the water or back to your car or sit at the benches and tables that are close to the restaurant. If you are a large party, it's a little tight but if you're a party of 2 or 4, seating isn't so bad. In any case, check out the specials for the day and the plethora of choices on the menu, you won't be disappointed.  During this visit, the boyfriend ordered the cioppino. It was filled with so much seafood. Looking at the stew, it looked like it would be too much garlic but it was perfect. The shellfish was cooked well and the fish was flakey.  They also give you a side of garlic bread but definitely ask for more sourdough bread so you can wipe your bowl clean. I ordered a bowl of their clam chowder. I appreciate that there's no diary in it and there was a good amount of clams in it. Flavor was on point and while the price is a little steep for a bowl ($12), it's rather large and it can feed at least 3 people. I also ordered the mini fish trap and shared it with a friend. The side can be coleslaw or fries and something else that I could not remember. We opted for the fries. The shrimp wasn't coated too heavily and it wasn't over cooked. Same goes for the scallop, fish fillet and the calamari. It also came with fried zucchini. It didn't seem super oily, it was really good. In any case, I would definitely go back. We love this place!",
            "You want to get stuck in this fish trap cause it's the best restaurant in Half Moon Bay! And hey, they got Red Stripe beer for $2.99. Can't beat that deal! Here's the deal...There are many seafood restaurants in the Half Moon Bay Area, but many of them are mediocre. They all serve the \"best\" clam chowder, some fish and chips and pasta. Why is Barabara's Fish Trap different? The environment is laid back, the seafood is fresh, and the portions are huge without compromising quality. The clam chowder itself is unlike any I've had. The base broth doesn't just consist of excessive amounts of heavy cream. I don't know what they use instead to make their chowder, but it is packed full of flavor! The pastas we ordered, whether it was red sauce or white sauce were all on point. Even their house sour dough bread is bomb diggityArrive around lunch rain or shine and it's probably a 30 min wait.",
            "The best fish and chips anywhere. This isn't some willy nilly review by a person who hasn't had over 100 orders of fish n chips. Yes! confess that I eat too much of it but it's kind of made me an expert on what a great plate of fish n chips should be. I've eaten over 100 orders! Now I'm talking about traditional batter, deep fried pieces of fish. I have learned all of what I know about what it's supposed to be by eating at Barbara's. First the fish. The fish I get here, without exception, has not been frozen. How do I know this? Freeze fish once and there's no way to bring it back to fresh. Frozen fish could never eat as good as fresh. It gets chewier with each day in the freeze until finally it becomes a piece of fibrous, chewy, nasty, challenge of dinner. Barbara's is my favorite and only place I will go for fish n chips. The outside / take out dining area is great but going inside gets you some dinner bread and butter in a cozy environment with a nice server. I have been served be all of them many times and every one does a great job every time. If it's my birthday, I'm coming here. The fish here is OMG. Once you've eaten here you will see. You'll go somewhere else looking for the same. Let me save you some time. You can go 1000 places and you get FROZEN. The only places I've ever found fresh fish and chips is San Francisco (lots of work to find and more money when you find it) and here in Half Moon Bay. I can't eat frozen fish any more so I only eat fish here. Plus you get a fair amount of fish. The hungriest will require two full orders or add in a bowl of that lip smacking chowder. They have other options but I come for the fBarbara's ? My favorite place to eat---bar none!",
            "I love supporting long-standing local small businesses but was sadly disappointed by Barbara's. The clam chowder was flavorful but really thick and a rather unpleasant gray color. I don't know why the restaurant proudly advertises \"no dairy fat\" because chowder is supposed to be creamy! This New Englander was not a fan, but at least the bread bowl was tasty.Fish and chips came as a rather small portion for the price and did not taste fresh. The batter was soggy, and the fish texture was mealy rather than flaky. The chips tasted like average frozen french fries. The ocean view was beautiful and service was fast, but this lunch was not worth the 30-minute line. I've had much better seafood in the area, though nothing out here compares to Massachusetts or Maine!",
            "I went to Half Moon Bay and decided to go to Barbara's Fishtrap for lunch. Overall, I had a good experience.I am not a huge seafood fan so I was happy to see that they have other items on the menu that aren't seafood. I decided to get the burger for lunch. I thought the burger was decent but not amazing. For that reason, I am deducting one star. I did really enjoy the bun for the burger. The cole slaw was good as well. However, this place is known for their seafood and not burgers. Someone who likes and has had their seafood may have a different opinion on how their food tasted. The service was great. The servers were friendly and we got our food quickly. All in all, I'm not sure if I will come back to Barbara's Fishtrap just because I'm not a fan of seafood. I still recommend this place to anyone who likes seafood because I have heard wonderful things about the seafood at Barbara's Fishtrap!Enjoy!Simona",
            "Came by for a solo meal while visiting the area. Even though it was around 1pm on a weekday this place was still completely packed and i had to wait about 10 mins to get seated. Service was very nice and I loved that they offered and option to get the fried fish as a side item instead of a full fish and chips meal. Service was very friendly and there's a very small lot across the street (I got lucky and snagged a spot otherwise it may be a bit more difficult). Also cash only.For my meal I got a bread bowl w/ clam chowder and 1 piece of fried fish.Clam Chowder: The clam chowder wasn't exactly what I expected but decent. It was packed with potatoes & other veggies and a ton of clams. The soup is thick but not exactly rich. They don't use any creams to make the base and whatever they use to thicken the chowder creates kind of a weird texture for me. It does have some flavor especially from all the veggies but it's not quite an award winning chowder in my book but for a dairy-free option I'm pleasantly surprised. The bread bowl itself was fairly average but had good flavor. Just wish it was toasted on the inside. (3.5/5)Fried fish: Definitely the star of the meal. I only got one piece but it's sizeable and the fish was so fresh and flaky. The batter is light but still gives off a lovely crunch. Flavors were wonderful. It was served with just a wedge of lemon and that's all it needed (5/5)Overall I enjoyed my meal here. I don't know if I'd stand in line for more than 20 mins but if there's not a crowd I'll happily get a giant plate of fried fish.",
            "This place is an absolute gem. It is a quaint fish house that does not take reservations nor do they take credit cards and yet all the tables are filled. The ringed calamari is incredible. It is fresh, tasty and a generous serving. The fish and chips had 3 strips of local rock cod fish with a generous pile of steak fries. I had a dungenous crab sandwich on fresh sourdough bread. It was awesome. This is definitely a place to make a special trip for.",
            "Go for their popular dishes-- you can't go wrong! - Clam Chowder- Fish and Chips - Crab SandwichThe clam chowder is probably the meatiest I've tried. Every bite had big chunks of clams. It was absolutely delicious!  The fish and chips are also amazing. The fish is perfectly breaded and very tender. I was not surprised to learn that it's one of their signature dishes.Finally, the crab sandwich; probably my least favorite of the three but still good. I think that it tasted too fishy for me.Service is very attentive and friendly. We had an early dinner here on a weekend night and only waited for 5 minutes. We were lucky to enjoy sunset while having dinner. The location of Barbara's Fishtrap is beautiful overlooking the ocean. Last but not least, I also recommend asking for their special beer of the day if you want a cold drink at the end of a long beach day!",
            "Bomb.com for clam chowder! But I would not recommend you getting the bread bowl with it - the bread was only okay.",
            "My wife and I came to this restaurant to check out half moon bay and enjoy some pretty good seafood. We were not disappointed. The food may have taken a bit to come out, but that told us that they were really paying attention to the quality of food that they put out.My wife had the seafood pasta and I had the Dungeness crab sandwich. My wife's pasta was delicious and the seafood tasted extremely fresh! My sandwich was packed with Dungeness crab meat which was so firm and sweet that I was almost trying to wolf down the thing whole. The restaurant gives a real home style feel and they also have a sign that says they'll add a surcharge if you're being mean, rude or grumpy just to put up with you which I found amusing. Parking for this place isn't too bad to find as there is a lot right across the location and if you don't want to eat inside they also have a to go stand right outside.Overall, our experience was great and we definitely wouldn't mind stopping by again for some great seafood.",
            "We made our way down the coast from the Penninsula to have some seafood in Half Moon Bay. Barbara's Fishtrap had been bookmarked for a while. We drove by within their first hour being open and it was jam packed. Inside was full, there were people waiting outside to be seated and even their take-out window was busy.We only waited about 15mins before we were seated. We were at a table by the back window with a view of Pillar Point. There were daily specials on a white board above us and I was surprised to see that some items were already sold out.I went with the coastside calamari ($18.95) It was a heaping plate of tempura battered calamari fried in rice oil. I chose to have it with rice pilaf rather than fries or cole slaw. It was really good. I loved the calamari. Big pieces of squid and it comes with tartar and cocktail sauce. The batter was light but it was flavorful... It's a really good dish. Perfect seafood lunch platter. The rice pilaf was just ok. It had bigger pieces of onion which I could do without. Also ordered was a 'krab kake' sandwich. That was really good too. It came with steak fries and all the fixins for the sandwich. Good flavor... Although they do tell you its a mixture of imitation and real crab meat.Service was friendly and despite being so busy, they had a great attitude. I highly recommend Barbara's for lunch. Good food, great view of the water and perfect Half Moon Bay weather.",
            "My favorite location for a casual seafood meal. Pleasant staff and the food is consistently satisfying. I've been coming here when it used to be called Paul & Barbara's , don't know the story behind that, but basically nothing has ever changed.",
            "At least the waitress had a smile.The fish is good. ( cod )A bit bland though.Cold bread was not appealingSent it back. Grilled with butterwould have been awesome.Who wants cold butter on cold bread?A bit pricy considering the Sides are extra.The atmosphere was nothing to write home about.The brownie was good warm and big. Been here twice. Bored already.",
            "my experience:this was actually not the first place we wanted to eat at but because other places were really packed, we decided to come here and we do not regret it. my aunt has been here before but my uncle just came in town and they wanted something fresh and we had been here a few years back so we decided to try it again. definitely a great experience and would recommend your families coming here. we had a party of 7 people and we were seated within 30 minutes.food/price:all the food was very reasonably priced as it is seafood and our favorite was the clam chowder. we ordered the fish and chips, calamari, clam chowder and another popular dish that we saw on yelp (i don't remember the name now) anyways, the clam chowder was so fresh and you could tell that there was a lot of meat. every bite had something different and it was great1FISH AND CHIPS - now i am not usually a big fan of things being fried but the breading is amazing and fresh. everything fresh is better and they definitely met my expectations photo's attached !!service:super friendly and used to tourists so they always give you extra time if you need it. great recommendations as wellthe place is quite crowded/small but the decorations on the ceilings are super cute! they only have two bathrooms so expect a line for the bathroom. notes:cash only!",
            "Friendly place, busy on the weekends.  Has the quaint old feel roadside restaurant feel.  But still a tad too touristy.  Most everything is deep fried.  And the broiledfish option leaves something to be desired. Tasty, because ... It's deep fried.  Small servings for the price.  Fish and chips had four ok sizes of cod and a side of chips(fries.). The half scallops and half shrimp was about 3 scallops and four shrimp and a side. I substituted coleslaw. Not worth the ~$23.xx to me.  It'll do in a pinch when you're close to the ocean and want some seafood, but value for money is average at best.",
            "Excellent food.  Prawns delicious as were fish & chips.  Cash only.  No cell phones.  Service rather abrupt - do you have a dish with both prawns and Dungeness crab? \"No.\"  So if you do t see it on the menu, don't ask."

            "Understand that this place has been through 3 owners over the last 5 years. That said, we had a fantastic experience this afternoon there with our kids.  We ordered some of the BBQ, the pickle appetizer and kid plates for the littles (there was BBQ on the kids menu-- nice touch). The service was prompt and warm.  We had a chance to chat with Michael, the new manager about the history of the place and his future plans.  Hubs is picky about BBQ sauce-- he likes it tangy and not too sweet and their's hit all the right notes. The meat was smokey and very delicious. We the brisket and the pulled pork. So delicious.Notable-- the pickle appetizer plate. Clocking in at $11, my expectations were high. It arrived on a foot long wooden board, and it did not disappoint.  Fennel, squash, garlic, beets, green beans, purple potato salad (not pickled, but a nice little serving), piquillo peppers, dill pickles, celery, and carrots. Each one had its own seasoning and was very distinctive.  The plate could have been an entree in itself.  The sides of salad and coleslaw were also quite good and appeared home made.The beer garden-- this component is absolutely necessary for dining with out little group of feral progeny.  We were treated to a cozy heater and the little guy had fun exploring. The last time we were here it was just a dirt lot (and there food was terrible).  I'm really hoping to return soon and enjoy the epic views and pickle plate.",
            "Ok, with total transparency I never actually ate here. But, that is in fact why I am writing a bad review.We came into town for a quick getaway from the city. After working all day- we head into this quaint area for one night of some rest and relaxation. After checking in we head over to Highway 1 Brewing Company to get some dinner. We arrived at 7:40 and they closed at 8pm. They turned us way. When I looked inside they had everything cleaned up and all chairs put up on tables.I worked over 10 years in the restaurant industry. I know that it sucks when you don't see any customers for a long time only to have one come in at the end of your shift, just before closing. But, you are open so you take them and treat them nice and get them some food. In fact, you can clean up most everything leaving just enough open or out so you can help a customer, should they come in. I mean, you take customers during normal business hours... it is basic customer service.",
            "I've been meaning to stop by this place after passing it several times. It was also recommended by a friend who lives nearby, so I finally made a trip out there for lunch.Located about 10 miles South of Pescadero Beach, Hwy 1 Brewing Company sits just off the east side of Hwy 1, almost directly across from Gazos Creek Beach. There's a gas station that shares the parking lot, which is convenient if you need gas too.I rode out there on my motorcycle and easily found a spot to park in their parking lot. They have a good sized tap room as well as a decent sized dining area that has large windows facing the road and coast. They also have a large, dog friendly back patio with picnic benches. I picked a seat in the dining room near the windows, looked over the menu on the table and walked to the counter to order a BBQ chicken sandwich with cole slaw and an Arnold Palmer. My order was taken by the friendly cashier, I paid and she said she would deliver my order as soon as it's ready. My lunch was $18, which is a bit steep for a sandwich, slaw and soft drink, but it was good, so I won't ding them for it.I returned to my seat and before I knew it, my food was delivered with a smile, as well as my beverage, a napkin, knife and fork. It looked and smelled delicious, and it was! The chicken was tender and tasty, and served with housemade bbq sauce on an extremely fresh potato roll. I slathered it in bbq sauce and chowed down. The slaw was also very fresh, crispy and tasty. I liked the addition of corn in their slaw. It adds a bit of sweetness to it. I also liked how it wasn't a mayo heavy. Too much mayo in slaw es no bueno! I also like how they serve their beverages with eco-friendly paper straws. Very nice.Will I be back? Absolutely. I really want to try their house beers and other food options. It'd be fun to go there with some friends and have some pints on the back patio.Pros:Location is epic, plenty of parking, plenty of seating indoors and out, friendly service, good food with decent variety, and pretty fair prices. Did I mention that they have a dog friendly patio? ;)Cons:There were quite a few flies in the dining room. They may want to rectify that asap ;) *Some reviewers mentioned that there's no cell reception out there. They have free wi-fi, or here's an idea....disconnect for an hour. I swear, you'll live!",
            "Had a great time with my husband and our two dogs! On a drive down from SF, looked for dog-friendly brewery along the way, and this popped up! It was packed on a sunny day (lots of other dogs, too) so there was a bit of a wait, but worth it. We noticed that some spots on the patio were opening up and went to the host to check on our wait time and he said he could go ahead and seat us, which was good. Had a flight of 3 beers and they were all tasty. Basically tried all of the non-IPAs. They have a \"dog menu\", too! We didn't get any for our pups because we didn't want to give them food right before hopping in the car, but it seemed cool.",
            "Excellent microbrew!! Under new ownership. Pleasantly surprised with everything. My favorite was the beer garden out back. Great location on PCH between Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay. I tried French fries, cauliflower bites, smoked sausage, beet salad. It was all delicious and served with a smile by the friendly and attentive staff. Some of the items on the menu are locally sourced and organic. This is something we can all appreciate. I will definitely be returning on our next trip to the PCH.",
            "We were starving. We just finished walking around Pigeon Point Light Station and hiking to see the elephant seals at Año Nuevo State Park. We saw the sign for BBQ and got excited.  No cellular service to check menu or ratings. Did not plan on half the group wanting to eat BBQ.It's convenient when there really are not any other options besides heading into Davenport. There is outdoor seating and indoor seating. It was nice enough to sit outdoors.  They offer corn hole to pass time. The BBQ in the back does not seem to be in use.  It held a wicker basket with some blankets in it.  The food took quite some time.  In the three meat platter you get: 2 thin slices of brisket, an old 1/4 piece of chicken, and 2 St. Louis Style ribs. Two sides: fries and chili.All the food was cold or warm, there was no hot.  The brisket was probably the most popular item because of the texture and color of the meat.  The chicken looked the oldest.  The skin had hardly any smoke color, the internal had no smoke color, and it almost seemed undercooked.  My husband and I left almost all of it still on our plate.The chili had so much seasoning, it was overpowering.  My husband loves chili and if it is spicy even better, this he just did not enjoy.  The cornbread was old and cold, literally.  The honey butter was ok. The fries were very greasy, but not bad.  The fish and chips were good.  The fish was moist, the batter mostly crispy.  The fish contained so much moisture, that the batter started to fall off the fish.  The flavor of the batter was good, but definitely eat it right away.  4 meals and a beer cost us almost $100.00. Half of us were disappointed and not feeling well a couple hours later.",
            "This place is disgusting. I was there End of December not sure if they were under staffed but Jesus it was nasty. The beer they serve you is always flat. I wish I took my pictures but I was so pissed I didn't even drink or eat my wings. They had no tables available cause they were covered with trash and flies. No one bothered to clean the tables. I had to ask the girl for my beer it looked like she forgot and then when we got our beers they were warm and flat. I ask her to please  give me a beer that wasn't flat she made a weird look like I was being picky. But $8 for flat beer? NOPE and warm fuck that. I'm at a damn brewery. Never going back.  GAVE IT TWO tries and the second experience was worse than the first. AT LEAST KEEP IT CLEAN!!!",
            "HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Was pleasantly surprised and informed of new ownership. Sparkling, clean location! Great for family and friend (dogs too!) friendly staff, yummy food, and the owners walk around and greet customers! A great opportunity to meet the sweet couple. The food tasted great, I had smoked chicken, beet salad, cornbread and cauliflower bites... DELICIOUS! So good I didn't want to stop!",
            "I stopped here because I like craft beer and any beer named after the legendary highway deserved a try!  I was not disappointed - more than a half dozen choices brewed onsite.  The beers cut across the alcohol spectrum, but in the end a nice 5.5 Ale was perfect.  The owner told me the local water helped give the beer a distinct taste.  I would agree; the beers were excellent.  I ordered the dry smoked chicken sandwich - the smoker is out back so I could see they were making it right there.  The accompanying Greek salad exceeded my expectations, until I found out some of the ingredients were locally sourced, with many organic farms nearby.  It was definitely a fresh salad.  The sun down in the bar window topped by stay.  Definitely recommended.",
            "Stopped here for a snack on our way down the coast. Loved the open front dining area, soundtrack, and beer. Their own beers were refreshing and not too heavy (like the beer in Seattle that I'm used to). The buffalo cauliflower and fries were tasty-cakes! Thanks for a relaxing and delicious snack, guys!",
            "This is a beer and barbecue stop right of the beach run up/down the pacific coast highway(also known as highway 1).There will be no problem parking as they have a unusually large private lot. Trying to cross the highway on foot however (to/from the beach) is more then usually hazardous. Try that on foot and you may just find out the full meaning of temporarily mortal. The inside is divided into both a dining room for those that want the sit down meal experience and a bar area for those who want the pub experience. Both have their flaws. The overall look is wooden and rustic, but this is an older very worn building and it shows. Typically there will be just about as many flies inside as outside. To be fair the beach is across the street and kelp flies are infamously persistent. The staff is solid. There's only a handful and they work their tails off. The service is fast, efficient and friendly. There may be some delays especially in the summer when this place gets slammed, but it won't be because they are slacking.The menu what isn't barbecue is of the fried pub grub variety. You know wings and fried things. Overall the food is......okay. Vegetarians you'll be limited to side orders, beer, cider, and plotting an intricate revenge on who ever thought it was a good idea to bring you here. The beer likewise is........okay. This is the biggest weakness here-the food/drink is okay but you are looking at super premium pricing for that okay-ness. Beer starts at 6-7 dollars a pint and the while there are menu items less then twenty you'll be looking at thirty dollar tab for a beer (or two) and some 'que. It's really easy to get into the forty-fifty range with a couple of add ons, most of which really won't seem worth it. The four stars is purely due to the hardworking staff, otherwise this would be in the three star range.I dunno. if I was biking up/down the coast I'd totally stop here because, beer, but it seems like there's better just up the road.",
            "Give this place a try! Right off the 1, 1/2 halfway between Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay. Just spoke with the new owners and they are so motivated to make this place go and fun! Beers good! Didn't try the food but it looked good, next time! Plenty of parking and great view!",
            "Well...I actually have allot to say but I will do my best to prevent anyone from making the same mistake we did. I wouldn't normally write a review but consider this my good deed for the day.Preheated food, no culinary skills at all. Don't let the pictures fool you at all. The beer also is horrible and nothing special at all. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR GO TO HALFMOON BREWERY IF YOU WANT SOMEWHERE IN THE AREA.have a good day.",
            "If you want to go to a brewery that seems to be slowly dying this is the place for you!!!!  Only four beers on tap...okay we can make this work. Asked for a snake bite (half beer, half cider)...they are all out of cider. This is on a Saturday during lunch. Hmmmmm. Friend orders Golden Gate amber ale...seems a bit flat. I play it safe and order an orange float (soda with ice cream). Bartender didn't even know what it was even though it was on the menu. We had stopped for a bite to eat and ordered sliders. Menu clearly states no extra bbq sauce will be given with food. That's fine...until your chicken and pork slider is dried out and there is hardly any sauce on the slider itself. Let's talk about a fly problem. Hundreds of \"marsh flies\" in the building. There are signs that ask for a pardon on this from management. Nope not going to pardon you...take care of your pest problem. We came here because a friend had wanted to go as she had never been. It was our fail for the day. She had looked it up online and it was nothing like the website. Dark, dingy, not clean (including bathrooms). She had hoped to purchase a growler bottle and pint glass to add to her collection. They clearly show the growler and pint glass online with purchasing options. We were informed they don't do those anymore. Oh and cell service....forget it. Both Sprint and Verizon doesn't work in this spot and when we asked for the WiFi password we were told it doesn't work that well to even bother. Do yourself a favor and go up to Half Moon Bay Brewery of you are headed north or Pour Taproom is you are going into Santa Cruz. You have been warned!!!!!",
            "AVOID AT ALL COST! Under new management, and needs a lot of work! You've been warned. I leave reviews for future good food karma, so I hope this helps! We came here Fathers Day yesterday, and it was a complete disaster!! Cons:-Ran out of sides: they gave us fries when half of our party ordered beans. They just decided to give them to us... not appreciated. I've never been to a place where they don't ask you first if they can substitute anything without your permission. The mac n cheese was already out, whomp whomp.- BBQ chicken was dryer than toast, and gave my jaw a workout. - brisket was fatty and undercooked. We brought it back and gave it to our dog lol- Cornbread was super dry- THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE FORKS!!! What kind of BBQ place doesn't have forks?!?! Imagine eating UNCUT ribs with out a knife... you can't lol. - They didn't have enough glasses for drinks- awkward- One of our plates was completely forgotten- Peach cobbler tasted like cardboard- BBQ sauce tastes like they added tapatio to extremely watered down BBQ sauce Pros-nice view of ocean- plenty of parking I'm doubtful I'll be coming back. If you're near big basin, I'd recommend Alice's on Skyline or Santa Cruz if you're going the other way. Just not worth it coming here. :(",
            "Don't eat here. The food is very gross and it cost too much money. They make you pay beforehand and ask for a tip but don't provide any of the duties that a waiter would do other than give your plate. The ribs taste like they are extremely old. I eat there with 4 guys and we all hated it and the room that you eat is extremely hot there is no AC",
            "Highway 1 brewing company is a little treasure in the middle of some of the most beautiful views in the world. Want to sit at the bar and look out at the Pacific Ocean, eat great food & drink amazing beer? You have came to the right spot. Looking forward to going back one of these days and leaving with a growler of ipa one. Yum.",
            "A road trip South on HWY 1 and we see a potentially charming spot on our left-hand side. We pull over and discover the Highway 1 Brewing Company, we decide to in stop in to have a pint.  They have a fun selection of draft and craft beers here, and we also decided to grab a nibble up front in the dining area that looks on to the beautiful Pacific Coast horizon. The place has a cute layout; a diner in the front area, a sports bar area with a TV as the central area, and a nice backyard deck with a firepit in the rear of the establishment.   We asked the cashier-host up front what was good here and got this awkward stoned reply of \"uuuuh, I don't eat meat\".   Ok, so what's frequently ordered here ...not a great first impression to those wanting to order something off your menu, or perhaps it was a warning.  We ended up trying the Rocky Range chicken wings, which strangely had only a few drummet pieces, more abundant were the flappy part that makes up the wing as if someone in the kitchen picked out all the desired pieces, and these wings were nothing special as if they were pulled from a freezer, warmed up in a fryer then swished around in some reddish hot sauce.  We had a second round of pints and thought maybe we order something vegan since this vicinity is practically Santa Cruz, and veggies might be more of a specialty in their kitchen, so we got the pickle plate.  Presentation was a mess, as if someone dumped a bunch of pickled veggies on a chopping board with pickle juices dribbling everywhere, portion was a little ridiculous too, it didn't taste bad, it was just awkwardly done, for two people the portion is way too much.  We saw a pair of patrons across from us order the same thing and they too had the WTF look on their faces as their pickle plate arrived, we took a generous nibble (ate about a quarter of all the pickled vegetables), but couldn't eat another bite, asked for a to-go container and was given one of those paper compostable boxes, lovely but not great for taking home pickled vegetables ...soggy soaked paper box to leak and then stink up the car, we unfortunately we had to leave it behind on the tables out on their back deck and let the seagulls have at it. Back to the drawing board with that item, love the uniqueness but could be done so much better!A few months later we were in Half Moon Bay at the Pumpkin Festival and driving southbound on hwy 1 upon our exodus decided to give the Highway 1 Brewing Company another shot.  The draft beers are fool proof, the food and service however, ummm well, let's just say from the parking lot, there's a fog rolling in that smells sweet and aromatic like medicinal grade THC, and it's not the patrons getting stoned, hey it's all good, it's legal now, as long as you can function at work, do your thang. This time I got the house made beer battered Fish and Chips which were \"meh\" a little underwhelming, I asked for some malt vinegar and the server returned with two demitasses; one with balsamic vinegar the other with olive oil? I ordered fish & chips, not a green salad ...stoner, lol! I have got to admit, it's the imperfections and quirks that give this place its laid back, funky northern Californian coastal charm.  And thank god for the gasoline station adjacent to the brewery, it saved me from running out of gas and getting stuck on highway 1.",
            "This was a perfect little beer stop on our trip up the coast! Sampled a few and particularly enjoyed the Jalapeño Saison, could definitely taste the jalapeño but it wasn't spicy, and the orange chocolate porter, nice hint of orange and chocolate without being sweet at all. Beautiful views of the ocean from the bar and friendly staff. Would definitely stop in again if we find ourselves in the area!",
            "Surprisingly good. Great beer garden. Enjoyed the fish and chips and Mac and cheese. Located right after the Pigeon Point Lighthouse, it's a good place to stop, eat, relax and connect with other people. It hasn't received enough notoriety, but it has its potential."

            "I went there on Sunday lunch and it was good, I wanted to sit outside but the waiting was very long (30-40 minutes) but to sit inside was right the way.Food was good, I had oysters, the crab cake and also the roll of naked lobster. Just fantastic.I also had a passion fruit drink, very good - just a little bit pricey for the size of the cup.Nice views, great atmosphere.",
            "I remember this place used to be better. We ordered take out.Lobster roll was ok. Calamari was calamari which is good. The truffle gnocchi was probably the best thing there which is still like a 3/5.The clam chowder was so underwhelming and bad. Usually when a stew or chowder is really good, you want to get extra bread and dip more into it to eat more of the sauce. There was barely any clams in it.Price wise, definitely overpaid for what we got. Location is nice though",
            "If there was an underground parking garage (and I realize this is IMPOSSIBLE lol) it would be a five!  I'm not sure how we were finally lucky enough to find a parking spot here...  Likely it was because it was a Tuesday around 3?  haha But even so, the only spot available was one we weren't sure was legal a ways down the street.  ;) Once we arrived at the door though?  Everything was one notch better than expected.  For a tourist destination restaurant, you can't go in with expectations blazing for excellent service, perfect food, and a table with a view available within an hour.  Sam's figured it out on the Tuesday we were there though!  It was fantastic!  There was a bit of a wait for a table, but there was space at the bar!  We headed on over there and my 1 week OVERDUE pregnant belly did alright sitting up on the barstools that had backs (thank the lord! ) The bartender did a great job making sure everyone was satisfied with a libation of choice while they talked about the gorgeous day outside.  Our table was ready in the time they told us and we ended up getting a great window table overlooking the Pacific - HEAVEN.  The fish was WAYYYYY better than I had hoped, Clam Chowder was divine... Our server was on top of things and the atmosphere was very chill, which I appreciated in my state.  ;)  My only complaint was that there were a TON of flys hovering about... I had to constantly keep an eye on our food and wave my arms over the table.  It was quite a bummer, but the overall experience was great and the grounds were amazingly romantic to enjoy a nice after meal walk.  We will certainly not be shy anymore to try and get in there if we spy a parking spot during a drive by in the future!  Ooh LALA***the review above has been sitting in my drafts for 4 years!  And Omg, the memories we have created here since then!  I'll be writing an update soon as a part of my hiatus Hail Mary return!",
            "It's actually a 3.5. The spot is great - big windows with great views of the ocean. It's a good sized space but still feels warm and cozy. Although the wait is apparently really long without a reservation with a reservation it was non-existent. Quick service once you are seated. Food is decent. Not outstanding. Clam chowder was standard. Calamari tasted a lot like calamari. The crab in the crab roll was yummy, but I felt like the bread was kinda over powering. All around decent food, but nothing impressed me. Decent sized portions. Very kid friendly. Crayons and all.",
            "Great place to dive into your lobster or crab roll.  We started with two lovely Mai Tai's which were very good, served with no straws, which is of a challenge!  I should have asked our server who was sweet, if we could get straws.  I thought it was a Eco statement, until I saw a straw in a soda glass.  We started with a special appetizer.  Sorry, not sure if it's name.  It was very good and super fresh petite diced ahi on a creamy foundation.  No chips like with a Poke, but, some crispy strips on top.  I think it would have been even better with fresh chips to use to scoop up and eat. I ordered the Crab & Shrimp salad.  It was very tasty, a good blend of fresh ingredients, but seemed super skimpy and needed some avocado.  It was really not instagram worthy.  So, no photos!My husband got the Crab Sandwich, which he loved.",
            "Sam's is an essential fixture on the coastline, it belongs here and it's a place everyone flicks to. It's the sort of place that has attraction to people as they drive bye, not just because of the red colors. When it gets slammed on the weekends in the summer time I totally understand. The crowd knows what's up and we're all going to have to wait. Fine. It's for the love of the food, the seafood. Lobster roll! Clam chowder in a bread bowl, seafood paella and fish and chips. Let's not forget the quintessential Crab Louie. And those chips those chips are battered and fried just right. come to think of it during a lot of healthy items on the menu here there's a lot of fried food and extra carbs but they are all delicious. Outdoor heated seating and multiple areas for larger groups or more romantic seating arrangements. I can go here with my wife for date night or take the family.It could be perhaps slightly overpriced for what it is. They are exploiting the location for sure but ocean front dinning is something that is in short supply. The view,  the market for food in the bay area and people's willingness to be that market all falls into place.",
            "Wow! Walked in around 6pm and this place was packed! We were seated right away though. The restaurant is huge with lots of tables and outdoor seating with fire pits and a great view of the water. Our waiter (Jose) was very attentive and friendly. Always checked on us and took care of our needs. Gave us good suggestions. He took our drink orders right away and served us sourdough bread. The bread was soft and chewy with a hard crust. Perfection!We ordered:A bowl of New England Clam Chowder (Little neck clams, Yukon gold potatoes, smoked bacon and cream). It was a HUGE bowl, perfect for sharing. They gave us 4 small bowls so that we could share with our family. Steamed Mediterannean Mussels as my entree. This usually comes with their house-made marinara sauce but I ordered it with garlic, Italian pancetta, leeks, chili flakes, fresh thyme (per our waiter's suggestion). This is the sauce that their Manila clams comes with. My son ordered the Shrimp Scampi and Linguini (White wine, garlic, butter, and fresh herbs). It looked amazing! The shrimp looked like prawns! They were huge. Since I'm allergic to shellfish, I didn't have any but his empty place told me that it was good. Really good. My husband and daughter ordered the Grilled Hamburger with Sharp Cheddar Cheese served on an artisan bun with Old Bay fries. (Go figure! We're at a seafood restaurant and they ordered beef!) The burger was cooked and seasoned well, and the fries were seasoned perfectly. Not too salty. For dessert, we took Jose's suggestion and ordered the Authentic Key Lime Pie (with fresh limes, sweet creamy custard, and rich, toasted meringue) Wow! I'm not a citrus dessert fan but this was good. Not too sweet, and inch of meringue, crumbly crust and a little pool of sweet lime juice on the plate. At first we didn't know why there was water on the bottom of the plate, then we discovered what it was. Boom!We'll definitely be returning.",
            "Stopped here in on a cold and breezy evening for chowder , calamari and a lobster roll oh so good! we were seated outside with the heat lamps on and view of the ocean so beautiful but I was still cold. Dinner was great !! take your time and look over their menu with lots to choose from but yes always get a bowl of chowder. Staff and service good! they do have a kids menu , dessert menu , great for events , weddings or book a lobster/clam bakes for your large party. From the patio they have a walkway down tot he beach, parking can be a bit challenging but we were able to find a space. CHOWDER BABY! DELISH!",
            "I'm not a big seafood person. But their claim chowder was delicious. Very hearty soup especially when it's cold outside. Eat some with their delicious sourdough bread.We also got the combination fried seafood platter. I didn't care so much for the calamari, crab cakes or the fried shrimp but the fried fish was delicious. I really enjoyed eating that fried fish. My son and husband liked the calimari. We ordered to much food. Next time I would just order the bowl of clam chowder, seafood spaghetti and the fried fish platter all to share among the family. Ask the server for extra plates and bowl to share. We originally walked out spending $121. We could of easily spent less if we didn't get the oysters or my husband didnt get his own meal. That's okay you live and learn right!?! Tip: we went on MLK day. Super busy. I suggest you call and make a reservation or if you know that is where you are headed go on their website and make a reservation before you get there. At least it can knock off some of the waiting time.",
            "What you need to know: - Large restaurant that overlooks the gorgeous coast - good for large groups and romantic dates! - Popular place with a parking lot that doesn't seem to fit everyone - Nice wait staff but they seemed stretched thin - Expensive food, you are paying largely for the views. - Most expensive price of lobster roll I have seen ($26.50) and on that day the price for the lobster was $49! What we ordered: - Bowl of New England clam chowder price $11.95 - creamy, not overly thick soup with clams, Yukon gold potatoes, onion and smoked bacon.  This was good to eat with the thick slices of bread they offer. While the chowder was good, it was simply above average, nothing too memorable. - Cioppino $29.95 - this dish was very good, it tasted of the ocean and the juices from the dungeness crab, clams, mussels, fish, and shrimp flavored the tomato base well.",
            "Came here on a Wednesday at around noon on the day after Christmas and was surprised because we were told we would have a 20 minute wait but were seated in 5! We Got patio seating outside and we're unsure of if that would be better but it actually had a really killer view and was extremely beautiful we got to see the beach right from where we sat. We were able to order relatively quickly and we had around 20 minutes to 30 minutes before our clam chowder arrived. Food: we got the clam chowder bowl which was definitely enough for four people but we also got the linguine the lobster roll the grilled chicken and also the blue crab sandwich. To me the warm lobster roll was probably the highlight of the meal because it was both flavorful and also a unique dish. The pastor was pretty good too it was very savory and the clam chowder was pretty standard but it was quite good and it tasted good with a baguette's that came with the meal. Service: The waiters here were pretty nice they didn't come by to often but they gave us bread and they also took our pictures that was pretty nice of them.Ambience: this place looked really nice and it was quite casual you could come here with family or with friends.Overall would probably come again if I was in the area it was definitely very hyped because I saw all of the TV screens with all the celebs who came here!",
            "Favorite spot in San Mateo county/on the coast between SF and Santa Cruz. Perched right in the harbor at Half Moon Bay. The location and ambiance set it apart, service is amicable and speedy. The lobster rolls and manhattan clam chowder are decent (don't stack up to Maine/New England rolls/chowder-same with Maryland style crab-cakes which are best experienced in Maryland), the Old Bay fries are phenomenal, the cucumber cosmo is memorable as far as cocktails. Sunset dinners and drinks here are unparalleled. Screens at the bar let you catch whatever big game is on, live music quite frequently, and heaters on the patio offset the offshore chill. Reggae Family/kid, dog friendly.I've been here 6 times in three years and always come back again when hosting friends and family from out of state/town.",
            "Amazing food with an amazing view! Make a reservation in advance if you don't want to wait, and asked to be seated outside! Such a great view of the water as you enjoy your lobster roll, stuffed with lobster (recommend getting the roll naked, just with butter and lobster) and any other fish--also recommend the fish and chips, fried to perfection!Staff is friendly and busy as the restaurant is huge and does a great business. There are heaters outside and dogs are allowed!",
            "Sam's has some incredible seafood, and you'll leave satisfied and full. The price is a bit high, but it is seafood, so be prepared to spend a decent amount.I went here with three friends for a birthday celebration, and I ordered the fried seafood medley. The calamari was nice and crispy, the fried fish was delish, and the crab cakes were yummy, too. The oiliness of it all did leave me quite full by the end, but it was very satisfying.We also shared a clam chowder for the table, and it was good! I think perhaps it was a bit thicker than I expected, and there could have been a bit more clams, but it was overall great to try.I'd come back, but probably only for a special occasion.",
            "Despite the fact the parking lot was full and the restaurant seemed crowded, we got seated right away with no waiting. Wow!!!!! She gave us the best seat in the house !!!i in the outdoor patio with heaters. Awesome view of the ocean and the boats decorated with Christmas lights . We got there just after the sunset and the sky was pink still and while we were dining , it started to get dark and the moon was out. So romantic. My boyfriend and I both ordered the lobster rolls naked and cups of clam chowder. Unfortunately the clam chowder was watered down, not much flavor. I like my chowder thick and creamy so , this one didn't deliver for me. Lobster rolls came with cole slaw and chips. Lobster was plump, succulent and so delicious. Cole slaw was good too. I wished we could have picked what flavor chips we wanted because I like sour cream and onion but comes with plain. Our server Brandon was awesome!!! Very friendly and attentive and super great !!!! The dessert was delicious. We shared the coconut flan with raspberry. Yummmmmm.",
            "Great views when the weather is cooperating, great service by Kaylin, and very good food!  It's a bit pricey so we'll only be coming here mostly on special days.  The joint is large and can get noisy when the place is packed.  It's not pretentious so you do not have to be all dressed up to dine here.  Everything looked and tasted fresh.  The lobster rolls, both naked and dressed, were hits with the fam.  My grilled swordfish was moist, flaky, and tasty on a very good and creative bed of veggies.  It was a good size portion!  Save room for dessert!  Surprisingly, their NY style cheesecake is delicious even though it looked so plain and simple.  Nice!When the weather is cooperating, the outdoor patio is sure to be a hit!",
            "Yes, Sam's is touristy.  It has been on TV and many peeps love jampacking this spot with good reason.The seafood is fresh.  The food is tasty...which leads to a hefty, expensive bill to be expected.They are traditionally known for their lobster rolls and chowder but I like to venture out to other items also.  Try the steamed clams and mussels.  Delicious sauces for both to dip your bread into...yum!  Seafood spaghetti.  I mean...there's hardly any spaghetti!  Can't complain about that!  It's stuffed with a bunch of mussels, shrimp, fish, and scallops with a spicy red tomato sauce.  Warning:  the bowl of clam chowder is enough to feed 4 people.  We ended up ordering 2 bowls for 4 and it was way too much.  Haha.  Grab a cup before you fill yourselves up prior to the entrees.  Service is always friendly.  Ask for a water view if you can.",
            "We were recently in San Francisco for a week, and spent our last evening at the Ritz in Half moon bay. I didn't want to eat at their restaurants and overpay for mediocre food. I enjoy eating at good local restaurants where ever I go. So after a little research, we decided on Sam's.We showed up on a Thursday night about 6:15 and asked to be seated outside, as the weather was absolutely perfect that evening. We were seated just as the sun was going down and we were witness to one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen. Even the staff was coming out to take pictures.When our waitress came and took our drink order, I ordered a tea,and she asked if I take sugar with it, and I said yes. I also ordered the sushi appetizer and bacon wrapped shrimp dinner and my wife ordered the crab cake dinner. A few minutes  later, someone else brings our drinks, but no sugar. A few minutes later again, someone else brought my appetizer. I was nearly finished with my appetizer before our waitress was in the area again and I flagged her down to ask for the sugar that was supposed to come with my tea. Several minutes later she returned with the sugar. A few minutes later she brought our meals out and we didn't see her again until about 5 minutes after we were done with our meals. We asked for the bill and of course it was another 5 minutes before we got it.The food was not on par with the view and the service flat out sucked. Would I go back? Probably, but only if I could be seated on the back patio because that is the best thing about Sam's.",
            "Just being honest...I think this place could careless of my review since this place gets 4stars. But those stars are well represented. Location is perfect. If your wait is too long take a walk on the beach check the weather you might need jacket thou. Perfect sitting area outside if not buys. I ordered the combination fried seafood and my lady ordered the lobster roll naked. I was happy with mine but she was not happy with her because it was dry so she ate most of mine. But overall I would definitely bring her back here and maybe try something else and also come back for the viiiiiew.",
            "First time visiting this place & definitely will return. The only thing I was not happy with was the dogs all over the place. It's dog friendly but owners forget about their dogs and they are all over the place."

            "Absolutely pathetic customer service.  I dont know of the lady behind the counter was racist or just ignoring us but me and my friend stood at the counter for a good 5 minutes while she was cleaning the kitchen and she said she would be with us right away. And then after she finishes her chores she completely ignores us and goes out to clean the tables??? Really??? Didn't think small town cafe shops still did this to people of color. This is the last time I'm ever visiting this shop!",
            "I'd rather have a damn good coffee than bad coffee with a smile. Locals might get better treatment at times than guests but the thing that is consistent is the coffee quality. Africano and double espresso are my favorite. No sugar needed, the shots are smooth. I once left my drivers license there and they saved it for me until my next visit. I was told by the barista that she thought of sending it but knows people move often. Thankfully they didn't mail it as I had just moved and they saved me a trip to the DMV.I love this place, it is the highlight of my distance bike rides. I don't need to be loved, just give me my coffee...please. My attitude is changed to gratitude after a perfect Africano, and the world seems a kinder and gentler place.",
            "Love this cute small place. We always visit it while on our way to Santa Cruz or on CA-1 drives. It is located in a cute town of Pescadero and its very charming. We usually buy artichoke bread at the neighboring store and eat it before coming to drink coffee here. They have nice coffees and all the usual stuff like espresso, latte, moca, etc. We usually go with latte and have loved it so far. They have the option of stevia making is healthy. Their decor is entirely museum style, filled with items from different eras. They have a small screening room, where they screen some movies and people sometimes sit and watch it. They have a small seating arrangement and its partially covered with curtains. Seating could become an issue when lots of people are visiting the store. You can find parking on the entire street and a little bit away from the store. After your coffee you can take a stroll in the alley to eat more food or drink some wine. I would recommend you visit it and see for yourself, how enjoyable the place is :)",
            "It was a quaint little coffee shop that I was surprised by what this little town has to offer. Maybe the town isn't little, this is my first time to pescadero , and I didnt know much around this place. And it's quite happening around this strip of town I like the vibes of this cafe where every morning you see different crowds gather around. Bikers, cyclists , hikers etc. Its like a quick pitch stop before carrying out their journey. It is fun to people watch and bike watch too. There are nice bike stopping by as well. I enjoy their coffee, especially the mocha and their hot chocolate,  it's really Rich and good without being too sweet. It's fun to look around the antiques, just a nice setup for a simple coffee break. They even have a little movie room running in the back. It's cute. And the owners also owns an airstream for airbnb, and if you stay with them you get a complimentary coffee in the morning every day!",
            "THE BEST coffee I've ever had and I live in San Francisco where we have the cream of the crop when it comes to coffee.  Will alwasys maske a stop driving down Hwy 1 to get my coffee fix here.",
            "Enjoyed the cappuccino from Downtown local. Must check out this place if you're in Pescadero. Their vintage collection bring back so much memories. There's a small theatre / projector made room that you can seat and enjoy the coffee.Love their sofa with the cut-off jeans covered around the sofa arms. Everything is put into heart. We had a wonderful visit!",
            "Very good espresso, not bitter, smooth. Friendly enough. Groovy atmosphere. Not a lot of food options, mostly just coffee.",
            "This is definitely a unique place! It's a coffee / antique shop. It is fairly small but packed with a coffee bar, seating , antiques for sale and even a small diy movie theater area. I tried the cold brew coffee, I thought it was slightly on the expensive side for the amount you get but the quality was very good! I would definitely recommend trying it. Overall, this is definitely the most unique coffee shop I have been to but I think that's the charm of it!",
            "WARNING: unfriendly owner alert. Adorable place, horrible attitude. I was really looking forward to stopping by this shop during my camping trip in Pescadero. I was delighted walking in - the shop was quaintly decorated with rad vintage items for sale throughout the store. Even the menu is written with a sharpie on a torn up cardboard box. I thought that was charming.I was excitedly surprised when I headed toward the back of the shop and found a tiny little hidden theatre that was playing silent black + white films. There were curtains drawn up on a rod. My boyfriend and I looked around, and he drew the curtains down as he was checking out the place. He asked the lady when they use the theatre, and she rushed over and snippily replied, \"Um, we use it every day. And you need to draw the curtains back. Please don't touch that.\" That was it. We tried making friendly conversation about the theatre, but her answers were short and made us feel extremely unwelcome and like we were in trouble. Listen, lady, if you don't want your customers exploring or touching that area in a vintage store coffee shop that almost encourages you to explore, then maybe you should put up a sign? Or make it inaccessible? We walked out immediately after getting our drink. We got a chai latte, and that was also a disappointment as the Chai came in a bag with some almond milk poured in it.",
            "Delicious cappuccino and iced coffee to sip while we snacked on the mouth watering pumpkin bread and took in the view at this amazing place. My husband and I were transported to our past with all the amazing things here. Definitely stop in and take your time sipping your drink.",
            "Excellent and bone-dry hot chocolate.",
            "This is a quaint little coffee shop/curios shop that serves yummy Sightglass coffee. It would be nicer if they had something to eat, too.  We got there shortly after 9 am on a Friday and they said they'd sold out of pastries...",
            "Very happy to find this gem a little off Highway 1 for a hot drink and breakfast on our drive down south. Friendly service and delicious offerings, including some vegan friendly.",
            "I like this little coffee shop. Perfect for a little town. The coffee is excellent and served with lovely designs in the foam. The owner is fabulous. Could use a larger pastry selection and sometimes the baristas could be a little friendlier. Overall a good place.",
            "I don't know when Pescadero became a destination spot but good for this little town.  I used to Moto through here back in the day and it has changed with a little co-op called Slow Coast and this coffee shop filled with pop culture items and Moto stuff with a definite bend to geek culture. Why did I give it two stars? Much like Slow Coast the pretentious attitude coming from its staff was off the charts. No \"thank you's\" or any other type of pleasantries were exchanged. My wife used to be a barista and she did not tip which is saying a lot.I guess Pescadero has the looks of a small town with none of its charm. The attitude of these people is as hollow as a bell. I suspect tech money here. Too bad.",
            "The espresso was not served to go as requested and was a very poor quality/cheap bean. It was one of the nastiest tasting espressos we've ever had, and that's saying a lot. The person who took the order was not friendly or welcoming. When I told her it was ordered to go, she just dumped it in a paper cup and pushed it to me. I guess when you are the only game in town you don't have to actually serve a quality product, even though you charge more than a high end specialty coffee store or provide good service. When we are in the area again we will definitely avoid this place.   I recommend you do too!",
            "Been here twice. One of the coolest coffee shops you'll ever walk into. Old school. Classy. Amazing. You know it's a genuine coffee shop when there are limited choices and when baristas really know their latte art as well as what they're doing. Plus, the baristas are so willing to make the coffee according to your liking if you ask!The espresso itself has a unique taste: star anise, dark chocolate-like. Parking is reasonable (you're able to find parking). Prices are reasonable.",
            "Coffe is good, not great but good. The older grey haired women there blows it for this place though, I didn't know you could be so rude and still have a job in customer service. She seems to be annoyed with everyone who walks through the door. Pretty sure she owns the place, and honestly I'd take Starbucks over her attitude. I'm not saying she has to smile at everyone and be super bubbly but I also don't need to pay a small fortune to see the lasers coming out of her eyes. Atmosphere and location is really what saves this place, only reason it gets 3 stars.",
            "I often use Pescadero as my turnaround point when I go for motorcycle rides and I usually stop at Duarte's for food, but today it was earlier in the day and I wanted some coffee. I had noticed Downtown Local before because there's a classic Moto Guzzi in the window, but I had never been in, so I decided to try it. The outside is clean with a couple tables w/ chairs, and the inside is like a curated garage sale, with tons of classic knick knacks, a couple classic motorcycles, and some locally made items. They also carry some Deus Ex Machina clothing and hats for you motorcycle lifestyle enthusiasts. You could spend 30 minutes just looking around at the cool stuff in there. I went to the counter and was greeted by the friendly staff. The menu is mostly coffee drinks and kombucha with limited food items*. I ordered a double shot cappuccino and what I think was a piece of lemon pound cake. Both were fairly priced and really good. I setup my laptop at one of the inside tables and did a little work, utilizing the free wi-fi which was pretty fast at 10-12mps. There was good music playing on the stereo, and I really wanted to work from there all day it was so nice.If you're in the area and looking for some great coffee and a cool place to stop and browse/shop for unique items, Downtown Local is a very cool spot. I will definitely be back again, soon!*I'd give it 5 stars if they had more food options. Sometimes I get tired of Duarte's and the Mexican food at the gas station. Some made-to-order sandwiches or other grab-and-go options would round this place out nicely."

            "Comfort Food meets craft beer lovers heaven. This place is a must stop if driving up/down the Pacific Coast Highway in Half Moon Bay. This is my second visit to The Barn and it again exceeded my expectations. To start, I asked for WiFi. Password was 'bestburgerever!'. Now how is that for setting up your expectations? I had to order the burger so I made it the Hot Farmers Burger with Sirracha Aioli and Jalepeno's added. Nieman Ranch Beef was used and it was served as ordered, a perfect medium rare. BEST BURGER EVER. Nice bun, good crunch, perfect amount of melted cheese which really satisfied. On the side a half salad and sure, why not, Storms Side Mac & Fry. No stop here is complete without trying the deep fried mac and cheese in a perfect crunchy square. When you look up comfort food in the dictionary there should be a picture of these nuggets of joy. DO IT. Now, the beer. There are about 5 selections of the best local craft beer you'd ever need. The staff let me taste a bit of all so I could make the most informed decision. Today it was the Bare Bottle Juicy Couture Dust Style IPA. One of the best Bare Bottle beers I've had to date. Alright, might as well have 2. Great staff. Great atmosphere. Fun open kitchen where you can learn some new tricks. Great food and drink. Do it.",
            "I just checked in (9th Yelp check in) and apparently I'm the duke of this place so I figured it's time to write a review. You're probably wondering why I'm giving this place 3 stars if I've been back 9 times. Great question. This place is basically a monopoly with no competition. There aren't many independent restaurants in the area with outdoor seating, so this becomes the go to. The main reason I keep coming back here is because of the outdoor seating that's perfect for lunch on a rare sunny day in HMB. The cons here:1. Expensive for what you're getting. I get a burger and fries and it usually costs me $20 for a burger they can't lettuce wrap. Burger is not mind blowing by any means. 2. Line is SO long. One cashier who takes forever to take your order and is not helpful when you ask questions about the food3. Food takes forever to get to you. I'm talking 45 minutes after waiting 30 minutes to order. 4. 20% tip default on their POS system when you check out, but there is no service other than them dropping off your food. No water, no dish service. 5. As I'm writing this review, the \"waiter\" drops off the food and as I ask him for a fork, he points me to the cashier to get them. Thanks bro. If a competitor ever opens up here this place is in trouble.",
            "I came here not that long ago, the last time I stopped by this place was when it used to be Blue Sky Cafe. After looking at others reviews I decided to order their Barn Burger with American Cheese and their Mac Attack. I placed my order to go and the wait wasn't that long. However, once I got home I was left disappointed. The burger lacked flavor, overall it tasted really bland. Their Mac Attack also lacked flavor. I gave one piece to my sister who loves Mac n cheese but she said she didn't like this one either. Food was ok, not sure I'll be back.",
            "Been back two times for their chili but with saying that here are some other things you may want to try on there menu, the restaurant is not fairly large but it is very open, small seating inside, large seating outside, good on a cold day or warm day, would not recommend eating there when raining but on a whole I will be backHere are some of the items I sampled and how all of them fairedWhat the Cluck - fried chicken sandwich, juicy not dry, flavorful, if in the mood for fried chicken this will satisfy your cravingThe Hot Farmer - made with pickled jalapenos, burger was good, on the smaller side but per the menu everything is organicThe Cleaner Weiner - add the chilli to this dish and poof amazing, must try this hot dog with the chilli, mind blownThe BLT - I felt this was more of a snackish food, meant for light lunch, I would order it againthe fresh cut fries - all I hear from the kids are yummy noises, the sounds don't lieThe Chilli - i'm a fan, been here twice and I can honestly say I will be back for more of there chilli, it is a must try, lil heat, good flavoring all the way around, chunky bits of everythingwash everything down with an ale or anything elsefor the kids the milkshakes are good, I recommend the vanilla just because my kids love flavor lol, the horchata is also goodfood ****chilli ***** wowprice $$service ****ambiance **** rustic, outdoorish, modern",
            "A great place for the whole family! A must go. I love the options.",
            "Returned here recently because I thought I should give it a second chance---but I was left even more disappointed. The burger portions have somehow even gotten smaller since the last time I visited. They are currently charging $10 for a 1/4 pound burger. which is essentially the size of a bar slider. Moreover, my patty was unevenly cooked.The owner claims that the pricing is due to their superior ingredients, but top-grade ground sirloin runs for around $5/lb---so a 1/4 lb patty likely costs $1.25 (or less depending on whether they buy in bulk).",
            "This was our first experience here, and we will definitely return! I love the farm to barn concept! The ingredients are local and fresh , and the burgers are grass fed. We tried the barn burger and the hot farmer burger. Both burgers were excellent! I also recommend the hand cut fries. They have great options for those who do not eat burgers. Tip: there is usually a wait, but it's worth it!",
            "ehh I don't really get it. It's not that it was bad, it was okay. Not sure what everyone is raving about. There must not be any decent burgers in HMB. The burger patties are small - think kid size (see photo). I just wasn't that impressed. The toppings completely overwhelm the beef. If I am ordering a burger, I am looking for a big juicy bite of meat that is complemented by the toppings, not lost in them. The Mac Attack is so salty you can't consume more than a couple bites.If I came back for anything, it would be another Affogatto Milkshake - AMAZING.Overall opinion - overpriced. For two burgers, mac, 2 beers, a soda, milkshake, a cookie and a lemon bar we were at almost $100 after tip, for a mediocre meal for two. Not worth it... not even close!",
            "I can understand why there are some mixed reviews on here. Yes, it is more expensive for less food. I paid $25.45 (burger, fries Mac, 1 beer) + $2.30 tax + $5.55 tax for a total or $33.30. It wasn't quite the quick lunch I had envisioned, as I was thinking more like a $15 lunch but I'm glad I ended up here. Regardless, you're paying for more than just the food here. You're paying for the experience, environment, and modern rustic feel that you don't get from the other restaurants in Half Moon Bay (at least not that I could tell). I think this business has done a good job with their branding and the little touches such as the porcelain(?) serving trays, beer in a mason jar, and making fried Mac n cheese bites with hints of sea salt on them - they were better than any Mac bites I've ever had because most are just greasy bar bites. Overall, I would make a point to a top here again next time I'm traveling this way. I thought the veggie burger was quite good and different than some of the typical veggie burgers you see. I think it could even be good with a a little spicy sauce on it too. :)",
            "This place has become one of our new \"Go To\" places when coming to HMB. The Barn offers a really great lunch outdoor setting serving burger/backyard food in HMB located very close to the highway (helps you monitor the traffic...) The star of this place is the really nice patio seating area with a few table heating lamps that is also very dog friendly. They also provide a ton of wool blankets to sit on or cover up--very nice touch!Food recommendations would be the beef burgers, soup and fries. The cheese sandwich for kids is good also. Don't recommend the chicken sandwich (see pic) which although tasted fine, the center was clearly undercooked which was a bummer for an otherwise good sandwich and great meal. The beers are great also and they have an espresso unit. Service is friendly also. Only downside--they have a single bathroom for everyone--so be prepared for a long wait at times. Other than that and the chicken sandwich, this place does an excellent job!",
            "We made a spontaneous trip here for lunch after visiting some pumpkin farms in half moon bay. This eatery totally hit the spot. We left satisfied, full and will be back for more.The quality of the food is easily seen. Lots of local or housemade ingredients, friendly staff, complete with seaside/outside decor and a dog friendly double patio! The items we ordered  were all amazing:1. What the cluck - chicken sandwich made from air chilled chicken , you can get this lightly fried or griddled. We had it fried. So much goodness. We found the goat cheese to be a little overpowering but the arugula, tomato and ciabatta bun were amazing :). 2. #1 burger (barn burger)- soooo juicy , cooked to order (medium). Appreciated the caramelized onions, and housemade American cheese!3. Fried Mac n cheese - MUST ORDER. So delicious. Cheesy Mac on the inside with a slightly. Breaded exterior. SO DELICIOUS.4. House fries - fries are usually fries but these were worth a mention. Crispy, fresh, potato-ey and perfect. I loved them. 5. Milkshake - YUM. Rich, creamy, cold. They did run out of the cookie milkshake - which was a disappointment but the chcocolate shake was delicious. Parking was ok, plenty of outdoor seating for the pups.",
            "It was just okay. The What the Cluck with crispy chicken was definitely what I was looking forward to. However, it lacked any discernible flavor. I felt like I was eating just to get full, not enjoying it. My 9-year-old son liked his BLT with chicken, fries and San Pellegrino--a $25 meal by itself. The grilled cheese was good, Mac Attack was decent, and chocolate shakes were very good. Service was pretty quick and the owner/manager seems awesome.Small things that annoyed me--why is there an option for a 25%+ tip on the cash register screen? This is a stand-in-line and order place, not full service. Do you want ketchup or a cup of water? You need to get up and get it yourself. Also, I don't like how places ask for a tip before any service has been provided. Imagine going to your favorite fancy restaurant and being asked how much you want to tip before being seated. I ordered two chocolate shakes ($16.78) and was asked if I wanted whipped cream. Usually this is a no-cost addon, but here it's extra. I was fine with it, but it would have been nice to mention that. Overall, next time I would probably only stop by for a shake or if the kids were being particularly picky eaters.",
            "We took a drive to Half Moon bay on a Saturday in Sept.  Looking for a place for a snack, Yelp Suggested the this place was a winner.It was also fortuitous that this was before half moon bay proper b/c traffic getting into town was moving S-L-O-W-L-Y.This is NOT fast food, expect to wait. The sign said it would be about 45 mins and it might have been 40.  There is seating outside in front and in back and some limited seating inside - but the doors are all wide open so inside is really like outside with shade.You order at the counter and find a seat and wait. We ordered some things to split. A burger, a cup of soup (we received a bowl - woot!), and some fried Mac and cheese cubes. (I kinda wish I had gotten the mac and cheese cube/Fries combo.)It was an EXCELLENT burger, the soup and the mac and cheese were also good.  I would love to come back and try the fried chicken sandwich and one of the pies/tarts on display.",
            "I loved the quaint look of The Barn, but thought it was on the pricier side for what you get.With that said, no complaints on the food itself. Don't order the What the Cluck (fried chicken sandwich) if you're pressed for time. It was worth the wait, but came quite a bit after the rest of my table's food (burgers, fries, and hot dogs) arrived.Oh, and if you have dogs, The Barn is dog friendly!",
            "Great bites on the HMB Coast Hwy!  We had \"Mac Attack\", \"Barn Burger\" and \"What the Cluck.\"  All equally delicious...we shared everything!  Service was fast, friendly and the food arrived HOT!  Beer and wine selections were limited but tasty.We sat indoors at a shared family style table, but there is plenty of outdoor seating for you and your fur baby.  Outside, they even have lap blankets and heating lamps for the cooler coastal climate.",
            "This is the perfect place to take a date (or just to impress a friend) when you're doing a scenic day in Half Moon Bay. There is picnic table outdoor seating as well as people can eat inside the barn style restaurant. It's cutely decorated with succulents, farm style decor like shovel signs and tin bins to put dishes and silverware in. They even have blankets out that you an use for more seat cushion. Seating can fill up quick due to it being a popular spot but my friend and I were able to land a spot before our food came out since we took a later lunch around 1:30pm.The \"What the Cluck\" Chicken sandwich was amazing. I got it fried which aided to it's juiciness then also added avocado and bacon. Mmmm! If I wasn't lactose intolerant, I would have been all over that Mac Attack because everyone around me was eating it and it looked so good. There is a good selection of beers and I enjoyed the touch of drinking it out of a mason jar.Parking is very limited right next to the restaurant so it's good to know there is a turn off right before The Barn where you can park in a dirt patch. Definitely suggest this because the dirt alleyway connected to the actual restaurants small lot is very limiting.",
            "Great little place off of highway 1 that we visited after going to the pumpkin patch. Food is simple, sandwiches, burgers, a few salads. Highlight was their fried Mac and cheese! Plenty of outdoor seating. The day we went we unseasonably warm so no blankets or heat lamps needed but they had both of those. Oh and did I mention pooch friendly?",
            "This place is 100% a hidden gem. Off the highway on the way to Half Moon Bay. They have an adorable patio on gravel with picnic tables, string lights and flowers. Plus they were playing country music  major win. The decor is also super cute and rustic. The food is delicious - I got the Autumn Squash salad and added Fried Chicken. SO GOOD  They have a small (but good quality) wine and beer selection too. You gotta come here!",
            "3.75/5Was looking for a place to crash/study for a few hours as I waited out the traffic in HMB before I headed back to the Bay Area. This was a wonderful spot to just relax and get some work done while have a solid meal. Came in on a Thursday for an early dinner around 5pm. Place was completely empty still. Parking is in a small lot so if it's not busy, it's easy. There's quite a few tables and outdoor seating too. The decor of this place is so dang cute down to the squirrel wallpaper in the bathroom.As a study spot this place is pretty decent on a weekday. Not too many people around, plenty of seating, and no one is going to pressure you to leave. Music isn't too loud, there's free wi-fi, and I believe I saw an outlet or two around.Got the Barnstorm which is a quarter pound burger w/ 2 fried mac & cheese balls + fries + a drink1) Fries: Wish they were crispier but for semi soft fries they were pretty good and very fresh with a nice amount of salt. The few pieces that were nice and crispy were delicious! They serve it with Sir Kensington's ketchup which is rich sweet and tangy with a great texture which works for a softer fry.2) Drink: I asked for half lemonade/half iced tea. I love Arnold Palmer's but this one didn't quite work for me. The lemonade is pretty tart which I like but the tea wasn't strong enough to hold up so it ended up in this half tart watery middle ground. Will definitely get just the lemonade in the future.3)  Burger: Bun is slightly sweet and fluffy. It's a juicy, well seasoned burger w/ a crunchy slightly sweet sweet pickle and some very well caramelized onions. I also loved their homemade American cheese. Really wish there was a second slice! My only complain would be that the burger is a bit soft and could use something else for a bit of texture. I would also prefer a less sweet bun since there's already a few other sweet elements going on.4) Mac Attack: A nice side item to have to the meal. Seems like a lot of people go out of their way for this and while it's good it's not amazing. The best part is definitely the even and crunchy batter. The interior is gorgeous but honestly could use more cheese (ok I also really like cheese). When it was getting a bit bland, I dipped it in the ketchup which really helped too.Overall, I really enjoyed my meal here. I also didn't feel too weird pulling out a laptop and doing work. While I wouldn't go out of my way for this place, it's a solid lunch or dinner spot with a great atmosphere!",
            "This place is absolutely delicious. There are plenty of sandwiches and salads for everyone, and even deep fried Mac n cheese. Everything they make here is fresh and most ingredients are locally sourced. I had the burger with grass fed Marin beef. The What the Cluck chicken sandwich is my other favorite to get here. They have draft beer and the sandwiches are big enough to power a day of hiking or recover from it. Even if it's a little cold to eat outside they provide blankets at the picnic tables! Highly recommend a stop."

            "The food is on the pricy side, but it's well worth it when you consider that the two alternatives are (a) to bring your own food and barbecue it, which can be much better but which is also a lot of work, especially if you're staying longer than two days; or (b) to drive miles and miles and miles for cheaper food--which won't save you anything because you will have spent all that bargain-hunting money on gas.The menu is small, but everything I had was good.  For lunch and dinner, you get your choice of two sides.  All four side options are homemade, fresh, and delicious.  The coleslaw was my favorite, but both my parents liked the baked beans, and my mom normally hates baked beans.I didn't have breakfast here, but the breakfast burritos looked good, and my sources tell me that the regular pancakes and blueberry pancakes are good.  The buckwheat pancakes?  Not so much, but then buckwheat is an acquired taste.The workers are very friendly and accommodating.  The portions are large, but the hours are short.  They're open on Fridays (dinner only), Saturdays (all day), and Sundays (breakfast only)--and that's only through October and if it's not raining.",
            "Just to be clear, this is a campground BBQ place. My husband and I were looking for somewhere to eat as we passed through the area, and there are very few options (I'm honestly surprised it shows up on the map). The food here is typical of a place that serves a captive audience: extremely overpriced, passably edible and underwhelming ($20 for a hotdog and corn on the cob, for example). Avoid this spot unless you are desperate or staying at the Costanoa campgrounds and do not have any other food."

            "Everyone talks about this place so I figured I'd come in for dinner one evening while in Half Moon Bay. The day we came in they were hosting a large private event, so service was understandably slower than perhaps it might have been. We ordered the ahi poke, calamari, popcorn shrimp -- all pretty tasty, nothing mind-blowing. The shrimp was definitely my favorite. For my main I had the mahi tacos and they were delicious. Definitely recommend. I tried my friend's coconut shrimp taco and that was delish as well. The semi-exposed kitchen is a cool concept, but for a seafood restaurant with heavily fried items, perhaps not the best idea? The scent of cheese, crab, and oil permeates throughout the dining room and it took days to get the smell out of my jacket. Not sure I'll be back, but glad I tried it!",
            "Insect I got the calamari, a prawn salad, lobster roll, and complimentary Brussels chips. I didn't think the prawn salad was particularly tasty but it wasn't bad. The lobster roll had big pieces of lobster and a cole slaw that was just okay. The Brussels chips were probably fried and not baked so they were very oily. Here's the part that made me experience not so great. I really liked the squid ink aioli dipping on the calamari. I didn't finish it so I took the rest to go. When I opened my box of calamari later that night (about 6 hours after I had dined there), I found a WORM in the box! I don't think it could have gotten in another way besides being in the calamari. Not sure if the worm came out because the seafood was fresh (fresh seafood tends to have more worms) or because I didn't refrigerate it right away. Either way, it was very off putting considering the other things I ordered weren't particularly memorable.",
            "This is one of our favorite go to places to eat. We love the crabby cheesy bread and clam chowder when we come here. We make sure to bring out of towners here too to enjoy the food!The only thing this time around though is the crab pesto pasta was different than the last time around. It didn't have as much pesto and they added an overwhelming amount of bell peppers. Last time the pesto sauce was perfect and there were no peppers. I would stick to the basics here, but we will still be back!",
            "Well I don't frequent Half Moon Bay. But with the EVgo charger just 2 blocks away we have tried this place a few times in the pay several months. Tonights experience is even better than prior. They now have a wireless ordering system for their staff so orders get to the kitchen super fast. Tonight we had the two-tacos (sadly who's Thursday special is about to end of this month) along with the fried brussel sprout chips and the crabby cheesy garlic bread. Thank you yelpers for the recommendation on that. The brussel sprout chips are a bit on the high sodium side so beware.",
            "This is a fun place and perfect for a large party. Service was great and attentive. Their menu is has a lot of options. We came here with our family and ordered just about everything from soups to apps and cioppino to pasta. I had the taco dish and they are so generous with the fish. Coconut shrimp taco was delicious and the mahi mahi was also a hit. The other favorite of the night was the Jeaux cioppino as it was loaded with scallops, fish, and spicy tomato broth. Crabby cheese bread was good too. Brussel Sprout chips were too salty! Other than that, it's a great place to eat.",
            "I came here like 3 years ago with my friend. I got the crabby cheesy garlic bread and salmon blt. My friend and I both thought the food was okay. We didn't get the best service and probably won't be coming back here any time soon. They do have nice decor though.",
            "This place has good reviews so we decided to come here for our anniversary dinner. It was very subpar at best. With the prices, we thought it was going to be a fancy, sit down dinner. First of all, the restaurant tries so hard to be a fancy restaurant but is more on the Olive Garden or Islands side. We had the clam chowder and it tasted decent, but was barely warm. It would have tasted so much better if it was at least hot... I didn't want to ask them to microwave it or anything but it was lukewarm at best. My boyfriend got the seafood cioppino with added pasta, and I got the seafood pasta. My boyfriend said his cioppino was tasty but would give it a 6.5/10. My seafood pasta was meh. The consistency of my pasta sauce was the same as his cioppino stew. It was very watery and I wish it was thicker. It was lacking in flavor and overall very bland. I ate all of the seafood from it and left the pasta.. it wasn't very worth it. The service was nice but overall the restaurant was not a 4/5 and I am actually sad that we celebrated our 2 year anniversary here.",
            "Wow. They found their way back! After the original location burned down something went wrong but we just returned on a whim and the new fish tacos are great again. Fresh and lightly breaded. Nice sauce and flavorful rice and beans ..",
            "Does not look like much from the outside, but this place was pleasantly surprising! I am really glad I got to try their food and would have gone back for more if I had in my visit time. The food was truly delicious, really flavorful.  The chips, salsa + guacamole was fresh and delicious. The fish in the tacos was moist and cooked very well. The highlight of the meal was the amazing, tasty sauces that were each of the tacos.  Really well made. The wait for food was rather long, it wasn't busy, but it was 7pm on a Sunday. Tip: the entrance is hidden on the back side of the building, in the parking lot side not the road facing side. Took me awhile to find it!",
            "Oh snap! Go take a look at this restaurant! Its all redone inside and the staff is amazing! A great stop for dine in or to go.",
            "Amazing brussel sprout chips.  Wonderful sandwiches.  My crab melt was terrific.  Strong crab flavor.",
            "My daughter and I found the place by mistake and were pleasantly surprised. Excellent food and great staff. Definitely a place I'd love to return too! The clam chowder was to die for, the crab cake was seasoned perfectly, and the fried prawns were a wonderful mix of flavor and moisture which made them melt in your mouth!! Check it out - you'll love it!",
            "came here for lunch.  surprisingly, this is the first time I ever been to half moon bay.  always see the sign when I exit 101 onto 92.  anyways, we each had a beer, order fried calamari app, and each had an entry.  beer is beer.  the calamari was pretty good. I had the crab cioppino + pasta .  most expensive item on the menu...  $32+4.  i thought the crab meat would be whole..but it was shredded..  tastes good but I like it whole still on the shell.. don't think they put in the whole crab either.  It was good but, not $36 good...  i think better off ordering the sandwiches or the cheaper items...  like in the teens  that would probably have been better...  the total end up being 96 before tip...  expensive!   if i ever come back, definitely ordering cheaper items and no beer...  a bill in the $50s would be more reasonable...and get higher rating...",
            "This place was soooooooo tasty, I wanted to eat everything! We stopped here for a snack while we were driving along the coast, and even though I wasn't hungry, it was delicious!We started with the garlic bread with fresh crab, and I could eat these forever. They were perfect garlic bread sticks, with delicious, slightly sweet and crab on top. Then we had three tacos: one fried fish, one fried shrimp and one grilled fish. All were complemented beautifully with different toppings and slows. The grilled fish even stood up to the other tacos (where usually they seem bland in comparison). When I'm around, I will definitely be back!",
            "The chowder was good the fish taco plate was well presented and really good, the crab cioppino was nicely presented but failed on 3 counts. The crab was cold, salty, and not fresh, the sauce was nearly flavorless, and the salmon mentioned on the menu was not in the cioppino.",
            "Once upon a time this restaurant was the best if the best when it comes to serving up fabulous fish and shrimp tacos. Since moving into their bigger venue, however, the place has definitely lost its appeal. We were quite disappointed in our experience with both food, service and value when we visited relatively shortly after the move, and this kept us away for a good long time. Today, we gave it another try, and I'm sorry to say, the experience was the same. We waited a full 40 minutes to receive our food, without a water refill or perhaps an offer of complimentary chips and salsa to tide us over during our wait. Once served, the tacos were only OK, and for $16, together with the wait, just not worth it.  There is a lot of nostalgia here for us, but I don't expect we'll be back. Perhaps those nit encumbered with the memory of what the place used to be will not be so disappointed.",
            "Had a nice Saturday drive with my boyfriend along the coast and we decided to have dinner here! Yummy clam chowder as well as the brussel chips to die for! I had the crab pesto pasta which was amazing and my boyfriend had a New York cooked perfect medium rare. Unfortunately did not have my all time fav cremer brûlée which made me really sad but I got chocolate lava cake and you can't screw that up! Definitely would come back!",
            "Great food. Favorite is their crab melt but fish & chips are just as good.  And the cheesy garlic bread?  Can't go there and not order that!Not only did they bring the birthday cake we brought in, but the hostess cut it at our table and served it to us. (Most restaurants bring it to the table and we have to cut it ourselves.)  After the cake was served, the staff brought us complimentary champagne.  Thank you Flying Fish for making my 80th birthday celebration so memorable.  Thank you, Minerva, for the most excellent and gracious way you served our food.  I can't wait to come back!",
            "SALT! So much of the salts on the foods! My $36 rib eye was so salty I couldn't eat it. My wife's SALMON was heavily oversalted. I don't know why they wouldn't just let you salt to your liking. Nope. They've decided for you.So: - 1 star for the steak being over salted. - 1 star for the salmon being over salted... But - 2 stars because management refused our waiter's attempt to make it right. Instead they charged us for the entire order AND added a mandatory 20% tip. If they would have done their customers right and comped the steak that I couldn't eat, I would have added stars back.Stay away from here, unless you're a deer  looking for a salt lick.",
            "Nice staff and good food. The crabby cheese bread was awesome, and I would order the brussel sprout chips again without hesitation. The crab melt was okay. The flavors kind of muddled each other, and I would have preferred to have the crab stand out more. Will likely stop by again when we are passing through. Even if just for the appetizers!"

            "The wait was about 40 mins on a weekday at 10am. We ordered locomoco (Kalua pork) and the matcha pancakes. Locomoco was decent, but nothing special. Pancakes were good and not too sweet.Anyways, the worst and the reason for the 1 star review is that they changed my tip. I wrote down an amount on the receipt and when I checked my bank account, they gave themselves more tip... who does that?!! Such dishonesty.",
            "Seems to have a perpetual waiting list even during weekdays, this in most cases indicate that food and service are GREAT.  I will unfortunately need to differ in my personal opinion.  The service was really good, the wait is what it is.  but where we fall short is the food and price.  Our order was locomoco (beef), cornedbeef, garlic fried rice, and matcha pancakes.The portions are definitely huge along with the huge prices.  The locomoco was average, nothing special.  I was expecting the gravy to wow me but was just eh.  The cornedbeef garlic fried rice topped of with ketchup and tonkatsu sauce with furikake over a giant omelet, again was average.  Matcha pancakes, definitely had matcha but would be better if a sauce accompanied with it...perhaps a banana mac type syrup.Our bill 3 items with coffee and tea around $78 bucks...pretty expensive and just not worth the 45min to 1hour wait.",
            "I came here on Wednesday with a a few coworkers of mine during the day. Interestingly enough, Morning Wood closes at 2pm every day and there is somehow always a wait! We got here around noon and we waited roughly 20-30 minutes-ish.Once in, there restaurant isn't very big. There is even a sign that states that parties bigger than 6 people will be sat separately. There are maybe 2 tables that can handle this amount of people, otherwise, there isn't much space. The whole establishment is really clean, the people are nice, work efficiently and there isn't a specific person who waits your table; all the employees work together.My coworkers and I ordered a lot of food, mainly to share. We wanted a little bit of everything and with all the other Yelp review pictures and what they had on the menu, we were juiced. We got the Loco Moco, the chicken, French Toast, Matcha Pancakes and potatoes. The exact names I don't really remember.Everything was prety good except I didn't get a chance to eat the French Toast and some other number because I am allergic to nuts. Be very careful for those with nut allergies because a lot of Hawaiian food uses macadamia nuts. On the menu it does state which ones have nuts and the bottom of the item description, but just be careful as we usually are.I enjoyed the potatoes and loco moco the best. Typically I don't ordered a loco moco - I am pretty stingy with my quality of loco moco and only order it in Hawaii or Noelani's in San Carlos. But since this place is Hawaiian, I said what the hell; I definitely was not disappointed. Pretty happy with my decision. The chicken is also really good, really crispy and deep fried well. The matcha pancakes were underwhelming; they hype just wasn't there for me. It is really doughey and something that I am not a fan of. It was definitely a cool twist on a pancake - although not for me. Overall, I would come back. What stinks their hours and how there is always a line. But it does make sense why they are always packed.",
            "Probably one of the few brunch spots that I would wait 1.5-2 hours for on a Sunday morning.I recommended coming EARLY. Parking is usually not a problem- you want to find street parking nearby, but neighborhood parking on a Sunday is actually not so bad.My favorite dish is the Loco Moco with kahlua pork! I also loooove the matcha Mochi pancake- although, that takes about 20 minutes. Worth the wait. It's a good \"dessert\" dish to have after a savory dish. Their portions are perfect for family style sharing. Prices are decent and the food is #worth the wait!!!!",
            "The wait can be ridiculous, even on a weekday morning. Some may find that it's not worth it to be standing outside for 30+ minutes. The turnover is slow. The food comes out slow as well (though I think this depends on what you order, since the corn beef rice came out in 10 minute but the Hapanese breakfast too quite a bit longer)The food was delicious, and the portions were truly Hawaiian. If you can stomach the wait, it might be worth it.",
            "So with careful planning and preparation, I FINALLY got to try Morning Wood!! No wait at 11am on a random Wednesday morning.We shared the Oh so Loco Moco (with Kalua Pork), the Frank Chili Plate, and the Miss me Matcha Pancakes! The loco moco was AMAZING!!! The Kalua Pork was so smoky and tender - it paired nicely with the rich gravy and rice. The chili plate was hearty and comforting but pretty forgettable. The matcha mochi pancakes though were the star of the show! The texture was super fun and they required no syrup! I would get this dish again. The menu is very creative and changes regularly which gives me even more reason to be back! Can you please add Yelp Waitlist though?",
            "I came here for brunch with a good friend last week, and overall had a positive experience. We made it out on a week day to avoid the notoriously long weekend wait, but still waited for 20-30 minutes. Between the two of us, we shared the loco moco, the black sesame bread pudding, and (mistakenly) a side of kalua pork. I say mistakenly because the portions are huge, and the moment the entrees came out, we knew we had made a big mistake. Anyway, food was good! The loco moco was flavorful (although hard to go wrong with meat, rice, eggs, and gravy), and I liked how the black sesame bread pudding wasn't overly sweet. To be entirely honest, I don't think I'd wait more than 30 minutes to get seated - I don't know if the food is \"special\" enough to warrant a longer wait. However, I'm really glad I gave it a try, and I'd love to go back and try some of their other menu items!",
            "Fun name, fun food concept! Be prepared to wait for a table for...a...long...time...but once you get through the doors, your stomach will thank you! Morning Wood offers an incredibly creative menu featuring rotating Hawaiian-Japanese inspired dishes.  When you read through the entrée descriptions, you'll want to order one of everything! It's best to go with a group of four...you won't have to wait as long, and you'll get to try more dishes!Food:- The Beast - Chashu bacon, two eggs over easy, arugula, tomato, sourdough, and crack potatoes. This is a massive sandwich! No wonder it's called The Beast! I had to pull one of those smash-it-down so it fits in your mouth techniques. The bacon is thick cut, and the bread is well-toasted.- \"Hapanese\" Breakfast - Ontama rice with sous vide eggs, pickles (takuan and purple pickles), miso soup, and mochiko chicken...the chicken was crispy, a little sweet, and super tasty. I was a huge fan of this!- Oh So Loco Moco - Steamed rice, mochiko chicken, gravy, and two eggs. Definitely an elevated loco moco! Again, the mochiko chicken really made it!- Kohala Midnight - Black sesame mochi pancakes, butter, berries, and matcha sugar. I really liked these! They're huge, so I definitely recommend sharing it with someone. I loved the texture of the pancake, and the flavor was great!- Breakfast Poutine - Crack potatoes, gravy, cheese, two eggs. These are definitely addicting!- Strawberry Milk French Toast - Whipped cream, strawberries, azuki syrup, arare, butter. Sweet and dessert-like. This took a LONG time to make. We had already finished all of our food by the time this came out. At least the sweetness was perfect for ending our meal!",
            "Don't come here if you aren't prepared to wait. Food portions are huge. Service is ok, servers were pretty swamped.We came here on a Friday at 10am and still had to wait 20ish mins to be seated. You might get lucky and show up while a bunch of people are leaving. We saw that happen around 11am. The menu has a mixture of sweet and savory but we chose the heartier options. We got the oh so loco moco with a hamburger patty and a side order of their Mochiko Chicken. The loco moco came with rice, 2 eggs, hamburger patty and their gravy. The gravy is so good! I could bathe in it. It's just the right amount of salty and rich and taste AMAZING with the rice. The portions are very generous. We both had leftovers and could have def shared one plate. The Mochiko Chicken was so so for me. It came out hot and juicy but we were indifferent about the texture. It wasn't crispy but not soggy either. The chicken was also covered in some sort of sweet and salty sauce that we couldn't figure out.",
            "Came on a Tuesday at around 11:30 and waited about 40 minutes. Ordered the butter mochi pancakes and the cornbeeforice. We actually didn't have to wait long for our food, probably only 10-15 minutes at most which was nice since we did most of our waiting outside. The cornbeeforice barely had any corned beef. Portions were big though, good for sharing and you will likely have leftovers.The food was really good but for a 40 minute wait on the weekday I don't see myself coming back. I hear the wait on the weekends is 2 hours which is a dealbreaker for me. I'm glad I got to try this place though so if you're like me and hate waiting, try a weekday.Not much parking, only 4 spots in front of the restaurant. You'll have to find street parking.",
            "After over a year on my bookmarks list, I finally had the chance to stop by Morning Wood on a weekday morning, and avoid the crazy long lines they have on the weekends. The line for the Friday I went started about 25 minutes before they opened at 8:30am. However, you should still be able to get in quickly for the first seating if you arrive right at 8:30. Make sure you write your name on their list as soon as you arrive! I ended up trying:-Miss me Matcha? (Matcha Butter Mochi Pancakes, Berries, Yuzu Honey Butter, $18, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Yum- I loved the matcha flavor of these pancakes, and they weren't too sweet. They had the perfect level of sweetness already, and I didn't need to add on maple syrup. The pancakes were fluffy but had a nice chewiness from the mochi- these are a must order! This is also a GIANT order of pancakes, and can easily be shared with 3-4 people if you're ordering other dishes.-\"Hapanese\" Breakfast (Ontama Rice, Sous Vide Eggs, Pickles, Miso Soup, w/Portuguese Sausage, $20, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Just ok overall. You can choose from a few different protein options: Kalbi Sausage, Mochiko Chicken, Portuguese Sausage, and Hiyayakko (Tofu). The egg mixed with the ontama (sushi style) rice was good, but the Portuguese sausage was nothing special. I wouldn't order this dish again.-The Hot Hawaiian (Hapanese Hot Fried Chicken, King's Hawaiian, Egg Up, Slaw, Pickled Stuff, $18, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): The chicken is WAY too spicy. I love spicy food, and use Dave's Insanity Sauce regularly, but this chicken was still too spicy to eat the entire dish. If they toned down the spice level a good amount, I would definitely recommend their fried chicken- it was nice and crispy on the outside, but the chicken inside was still juicy. However, I didn't like the slaw- it was too tart and creamy. -Japataters (Crack Potatoes, Okonomi Sauce, Kewpie, Pickled Ginger, Scallions, Katsuobushi, $11, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Yum- I loved how crispy these potatoes were! The sauces on top were good, but it needed more kewpie.  Still recommended!Service was mostly solid here, although the servers get pretty busy and you'll likely have to flag them down to get a to-go box and your check. I hope to be back to try their loco moco, and a toned down hot fried chicken! There isn't much parking here- they have four parking spots available in their small lot (shared with a couple of other businesses), and there is also some free street parking available.",
            "Delicious food but the wait time was quite long on the weekend. I would definitely recommend coming on an off day. Why I was here // My fiance and I have tried before to come here but we came too late and the waitlist was already closed off. This was when we knew we had to come early, so we decided to stop by for breakfast before our hike in Pacifica. The wait time ended up being over an hour! We were starving and standing around in the cold watching netflix on our phone was our only distraction from the hunger. Food // OMG, we were so hungry, we pretty much ordered the entire menu and with it being only two of us, we definitely got some stares and pointed fingers... oh well, we were famished! The food portions are pretty sizeable and we definitely ordered too much food LOL-Corncheeseorice = fried rice with an egg and okonomiyaki like sauce was one of our faves! -kurogoma Mochi pancakes = love the flavor of black sesame infused with this mochi pancake. The texture was superb and I could eat it all day! -hapanese breakfast = rice bowl with a poached eggs, miso soup and sausage is a full and hearty meal. I really enjoyed this one and would love to have it every day! - Sandwich - I forgot the name of this one, but I wanted to like it more. Granted maybe I was just too full to fully enjoy but this was my least favorite of the 4 dishes. It was on the oily and heavy side and since we were planning to do a hike, I stayed away. Overall // Service was super friendly and I really enjoyed the food. The wait time though, was maybe a tad too long for me, since I get hangry and end up ordering enough food to feed an army. Take a toll on my wallet.... lol",
            "I love coming here but I have a couple of issues with this place. There is always a  CONSTANT LONG LINE and be prepared to wait at least an hour  and a half if you don't get there right when they open! Another issue is that you can not modify any of the orders at all EVEN IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES! FYI the menu changes quite frequently so if you have favs one visit it may not be there the next time!  Any items that have * next to it are items that change. This place is also expensive and you can't even get the food the way you'd like it!Besides those issues the food is good and high quality! Which is why I still go but very infrequently. A couple of my favs are the matcha mochi pancakes and the loco moco!!!Again be prepared to wait at least an hour!!!",
            "Whoa so good! I finally got to eat here. The first attempt resulted in nothing because the wait was about an hour even for a weekday. This time I went again on a weekday but around 11:15am. There were two small parties ahead of us and we sat within 15-20 minutes. The bad thing is that the servers seemed to be pretty swamped and it was hard flagging them down for anything.Now onto the food. I only got to try one dish: the chili frank. It was a cold day and the thought of piping hot, homemade chili and sausages on top of rice was super appealing. And it totally satisfied. It wasn't overly salty and went perfect with the rice. It comes with a really creamy, sauce-heavy slaw that had good flavor was a bit too heavy and too savory for me. Something with a light dressing would've offset the heaviness of the chili better.There was so many delicious things on the menu I wanted to order but I'll have to come back. A sizable portion of the menu does change weekly so something you're eyeing might not be there the following week. The portions of all the entrees are HUGE, and rightly so given the SF-like pricing, so you'll probably only eat about half of what you order.",
            "WHEN: Sunday Morning Here's the timeline10:20am- Signed in.11:30am - Name called, but table was given to party before us. Waited only another 5 mins.11:35am -  Seated at a large table for 4. Felt like an upgrade! PARKING:  After I did a tuck-n-roll move out of the car to sign our name in, my sis and aunt found a spot just a block up around the corner. Not bad!So my party of 3 went to Never Too Latte a few blocks over to snack while we waited.  We came back around 11:20am until our party was up!It was our first time and we treated it as if it would be our last. Sure, we weren't hungry, but here's what was had:YUZU TALKIN' TO ME? - $18Yuzu Butter Mochi Pancakes, Li Hing Mui , Yuzu Honey Butter.This was my favorite out all that we ordered.  The texture of this pancake was perfect--it had the wonderfulness you'd expect from a mochi cake--but fluffy and thin.  The yuzu flavor was subtle in both the pancake and butter.  As for the Li Hung Mui, which is known to be a semi salty dried plum, known for its potent taste, was a nice subtle touch as a sprinkled topping!  I loved it!  As leftover, just nuke it and its soft again.   SO GOOD!!!JAPATATERS - $11Crack Potatoes, Okonomi Sauce, Kewpie, Pickled Ginger, Scallions, Katsuboshi.This is a HUGE serving.  Wow...and its topped with all the wonderful ingredients.  The potatoes were well seasoned and crispy on the outside.   The Okonomi Sauce is kind of like hoisin sauce where its both sweet and savory.  There was plenty of kewpie, which Japanese mayonaise with the full egg taste (yolk).  Katsuobushi is dried, fermented, and smoked skipjack tuna. It is also known as bonito flakes, where it makes your food look like its dancing!  With all the ingredients of all types--creaminess from the kewpie, Savories from the Okonomi sauce and seasoned potatoes, and the pickled ginger, it all just comes together so well and balanced.  SO DELICIOUS!OH SO LOCO MOCO - $16Steam Rice, Mochiko Chicken, Gravy, 2 Eggs.Mochiko chicken is a popular Hawaiian dish, where bite sized pieces of chicken are marinated in a sweet and salty sauce, and fried.  There's some sandwiched between white rice and eggs.  Quite the hearty meal!  Not bad!KIMCHEEZORICE - $16Spam Kimchi Fried Rive, Sous Vide Egg, Mozzarella Cheese, Omelet, House Sauce.This was a tad overwhelming.  There's kimchee fried rice with chopped pieces of spam--which is really good.  I don't think I care for the cheese part, nor the egg part (too overly done).  Overall its fine and makes a nice leftover.  Just wish it wasn't the last to come out hahaService here was pretty good.  The wait is ridiculous but luckily there are things to do nearby: like the Salvation Army nearby, or do what I do and hang out at a nearby cafe.  But do leave room to eat!  There's so many great options, you'll want to try a lot of things!  Don't worry, these items were still great as leftovers.  It's definitely worth trying once.  It's quite the unique experience if you love brunch!",
            "Dropped by on a Sunday and more of half their menu was sold out 30 minutes till closing! Didn't mind though. They were really apologetic about it, and tried their best to accommodate to everything. So, my tip to you is if you want the full experience - SHOW UP EARLY!Continuing on, ended up ordering their Loco Moco, Black Sesame Bread Pudding, and Yuzu Mochi Pancakes! All which were amazing! They were out of the hamburg patty for the loco moco, so we substituted for the fried chicken, and omgah, the texture of the fried chicken was the PERFECT crispiness along with flavor. I don't even know if I need to try the hamburg, haha. Gravy was just as good as the fried chicken - only thing though, I wish the rice were seasoned or something. Was kind of watery and bland compared to the rest of the dish. Usually, that wouldn't be a problem, but in this case, I didn't want to eat the rice. The Black Sesame Bread Pudding, despite its name, is less pudding than bread, haha. Was a nice, different texture. The black sesame flavor isn't overpowering as in most black sesame desserts. A nice treat for brunch! Last but not least - the Yuzu Mochi Pancake! Love the mochi consistency of the pancake, and omg the servings are humongous! The day we came, the flavor was yuzu and li hing mui which is that tarty Chinese spice I believe. Was a fan of the yuzu, but the li hing mui not too much. I've seen yelp images of a matcha version though and I really want to try that. Definitely was delicious irregardless of the flavors my tongue was not used to though. All pancakes should be mochi pancakes. Service here was absolutely amazing. Felt like a family restaurant that was relatively Asian/Hawaiian themed. Loved the coziness and would definitely come back.",
            "Been dying to try Morning Wood ever since we came across on Yelp last year. The dreaded wait time can go up to two hours on a weekend. If you live close by, put your name down on the list and simply come back an hour later.  Made the rookie mistake of not peeking at what the neighboring tables ordered. Brace yourself, portions are huge here.  The loco moco was a towering monster of rice, beef patty, and two sunny side up eggs. The whole thing's then topped off with a general serving of gravy, the heart and soul of the dish.  Flavorful dish with a single downside - insipid patty.Cracked potatoes were alright.  Crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside.  Despite the overall dark \"tone\" of the dish, the seasoning was a bit light for our tasting.The biggest issue with the whole dining experience was the timing in the serving of dishes. The waffle wasn't served till 10 to 15 minutes after everything else were ready and hot on the table.  An alright experience but definitely not worth waiting two hours for.",
            "Came here with colleagues for lunch today. Even on a weekday the place was packed and had a waiting going on. We were party of 4 and had to wait for good 15 minutes to get a table. Immediately the server got water for the table and gave us time to go through the menu. Food Morning Jook 4/5 - I ordered this after seeing some pictures on yelp. Creamy rice served with crispy bacon jam, kimchi, tempura, garlic sauce reduction and sous vide egg. Very flavourful and comforting. Tempura was the star of the dish, very crispy and seasoned. I have never had Japanese breakfast before so this was something new for me. I enjoyed it !!Ed n'yo mamie omelet - 5/5Bomb !!! A must order for vegetarians. The omelet was so creamy and flavourful. Loco moco - 5/5 Fried chicken, gravy, rice and eggs just perfection !!!! Buttermilk Pancakes 10/5 OMG !! Never had pancakes this good. I am not a pancake girl but they were just amazing. Crispy yet very soft. Highly recommend getting this !!! Service 3.5/5Too slow !! We had to wait for good 30 minutes to get food on our table. All the dishes came separately and we ended up getting most of it boxed.Ambience Nice place with Hawaiian theme. Looks like it's a staple for locals as it was packed even on a weekday. I would love to come back again to try more things from there menu. Note- They keep on revising there menu.",
            "I first came across Morning Wood at their weekend pop-up in San Francisco (at INDO in the Castro). The food and service was AMAZING. Once I heard they were located in San Bruno, I promised to myself that I would visit the next time I was nearby. Perhaps I had extremely high expectations, but I was a little let down with my experience.AMBIANCE is warm and cozy, but be warned that the space can get packed easily. When I arrived, there were no tables, but I was told that groups were finishing up their meals. I came during the weekday, so there were no lines (a perfect tip for those who want to avoid the weekend brunch lines). Despite no line, I was told to stand outside while a table of guests were paying and the space was being cleaned. Outside. In the rain. No other guests waiting. I suppose this was custom practice for the long lines, but I felt a little isolated and unwelcome after asking if I could simply wait inside the few minutes since nobody else was waiting. The customer service went downhill from there. I found myself reaching for napkins and grabbing silverware myself after the awkward entrance throughout the rest of the meal.ORDERED Oh so loco moco ($14), buttermilk pancakes ($12), and chamomile tea ($3.50).FOOD was good, just as I remembered. Unfortunately, the mood from myself and the staff was so stale that I scarfed my food down and took the rest to go.OVERALL a tart three stars here. A different experience from the pop up in San Francisco, but I still support the great tastes and vibe originated by the owners."

            "Yes, this place is touristy and overpriced. But they have a great fish sandwich, so I put up and shut up. Plus, eating and sitting on a patio surrounded by dogs is pretty close to heaven on earth. Out of the other items I've tried, the fish sandwich is the one I reorder. The waiter asked if we wanted coleslaw or fries. I chose the coleslaw and my friend had the fries. Their coleslaw is spot on. I had some of my friend's fries, and they were perfectly crispy. However, when the server was asking the table next to us which sides they wanted, he said they could go half/half fries and slaw as well. Well, I would've liked that option as well. But good to know for the future. I'd try my best to avoid coming here on the weekend. Parking can be hard and the wait can be long. The last time I came was on a weekday. There were only a few tables, but that meant good service and food coming quickly out of the kitchen.",
            "I have been here many times over the years. I'll​ start by saying that I love their beer. That's​ why it pains me to give them less than 5 stars, but I just can't in good conscience​ go higher than three​. In fact, if I didn't​ like the beer as much as I do, I would be forced to go lower. I have had many amazing meals here over the years. However, today was miserable. I ordered a $19 crabcake benedict. What arrived on my plate was a poorly fried egg and an oily sad excuse for a crab cake on ... wait for it ... a brioche​ bun. I'm​ not sure what alternate universe they are from but that is a glorified fried egg sandwich​, not a $19 benedict that deserves a place on a brunch menu​. And don't get me started on the cheap imitation of​ hollandaise​ sauce they drizzled on top​. This dish left me with a feeling of walking into a theater expecting​ a Hollywood​ blockbuster and getting a poorly voiced over kung-fu movie from the 80s. The only explanation​ I have is that they must have changed management or ownership who has decided to cut costs (and corners). I may never be able to come back. :(I will say, the view from the patio is great and they allow dogs so its a great place for a drink in the sun. Stick to the beer and don't​ order any food. If you must​, go for the nachos. It's hard to mess those up.",
            "Took my dog, Moose, out to play on Mavericks beach for his 11th birthday. On our way home, we saw that Half Moon Bay Brewing Company has a dog friendly patio so we dropped in for a late lunch.We ordered:- Crispy Calamari: hot and crispy without feeling too heavy. This appetizer comes in a pretty big basket so definitely share this!- Ceviche: Chips that came with it were alright but I really enjoyed how refreshing the fish ceviche was.- Saison x2: Reaaaally smooth beer but nothing too special.- Lavender Lemon drop: This one was pretty interesting. It tastes like lemonade infused with lavender and a touch of alcohol. The drink color is really pretty as well! Highly recommend trying this one out.- Cran-Razz Belgian Blonde: If you're a fan of Framboise Lambic like I am, you will DEFINITELY like this one. It tastes quite similar but it's less sweet. Really recommend it!Service was alright, it was kind of slow getting our food and drinks but the ambiance is totally worth it. You get to drink under the warm sun, Moose gets a ton of pets from strangers (he's a total ham), and the vibe of the restaurant is great. I am coming back here for sure!",
            "My expectations weren't set too high with HMB Brewing Co. being a part of the Capistrano Rd. tourist hype, but damn, they nailed the \"highway robbery\" experience.  My date and I only ordered a few dishes after noticing the huge portions served around us.We had reservations later but showed up earlier and were promptly seated on the patio at the coastside window by the friendly hosts.  20 minutes later, no sign of our waitress or water.  The dilemma was finding another place to enjoy a view and dine.  However, the traffic on 1 and exorbitant amount of people out on this sunny day would make that a challenge.  Seconds into our search, our waitress showed up, and we were relieved and optimistic our appetites would be satiated and experience would do a 180°, despite the rough start.We ordered a couple Calf-iene Coffee Milk stouts, which were delicious.  In fact, they had an enticing beer menu to pique our interest!  However, the food literally robbed us of further exploration.  Yes, literally...  The raw oysters were fair, but those are served by numbers, and freshness can't be difficult by the coast.The major fails (points of robbery):  Artichoke hearts for $14 were a haphazard conglomeration of their special brewery co. beer battered bits (quite bland btw) and artichoke leaves with some legitimate hearts.  Sacrilege in downtown HMB puts this appetizer to absolute shame.  The ultimate \"hold up\" was Avo's Portuguese Fisherman's Stew for $27 (see photo).  Forget the tiny bits of seafood served as an appetizer sized dish!  The banal \"garlic broth\" was far from being simmered with tomato, cilantro, fennel, red and green onion.  Most of these flavors were nonexistent in this simple butter broth and quite frankly, Avo must've left the building.  This is no stew, and the portion size does not warrant the price point. Clearly, the chef and company is just throwing it all together here.  Good garlic bread, brew, and outdoor patio but just another spot with no passion for the ailment and riding off the touristy locale- plus our server was barely there. So sad.",
            "My cousin took me here when I visited San Fran in October. We went on a Thursday and it was pretty slow. She told me that on weekends this placed gets packed so it was nice that we were able to pick any seats outside facing the water. The views here were beautiful but it was a bit chilly that day so I decided to start with their clam chowder soup. It's probably one of the best I've ever had. Piping hot, super thick, chunky and loaded with clams. I got the bowl size for $9 and it was enough to share. We also shared an order of Fish and Chips. They were decent but kinda lacked taste. However, the batter was crunchy and fries were perfectly crisp. It was $17 so it's little steep but the portion was big enough to fill both of us up. We didn't try any beer but I had a cocktail called Blackberry Bourbon Smash. It was light and refreshing but too sweet for my taste. We had an OK time here. Nice and chill. Plus the drive on PCH 1 from Daly City to Half Moon Bay was gorgeous.",
            "We tasted a lot of things, and they were all pretty good! I was a fan of the decor, which is definitely the sort of nautical theme that you want from a seaside restaurant. Our waiter was also very friendly. He and the kitchen did an incredible job serving and getting all the food out at roughly the same time for our large (30 person) group. I had the ribeye steak $32.95, boyfriend had the fresh catch, which was salmon $24.95 and we split a clam chowder bread bowl $11. In the past, I've been hesitant to order \"rare\" steaks, because I'm worried about receiving a bloody slab of meat. Medium rare always seems safer. This time, thanks to the encouragement of the waiter, I ventured to order my steak rare and it was the perfect doneness on the inside. The thing is, I also love a crisp sear on the outside of the steak, and that's pretty much impossible to get with a rare steak. Maybe I'll just have to wean myself off restaurant steaks. It's also an expensive habit. The ribeye came with some super garlicky broccoli and potatoes. I was especially a fan of the broccoli. I might try to replicate them at home. The salmon was also quite good -- it came with a mango salsa, some asparagus and rice. Clam chowder was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again because it's just impossible to finish two entrees and a clam chowder. Fried calamari and french fries were crispy without being overly greasy -- would definitely order again. Ahi poke was good and a decent portion, but served with tortilla chips. I'd rather have poke at poke bowl type place. Hamburgers and nachos were okay too, but there were better things on the menu.",
            "A plane of 4 of us flew down from Santa Rosa to the HMB Brewing Company recently. We arrived on a beautiful day just after the fog had burned off. We walked up to an absolutely packed restaurant. While we didn't wait long for our seats, service was kind of slow. I ordered fish tacos that were a solid 2.5 stars out of 5. They really didn't have good flavor to them, and whatever aioli/sauce was used did not complement the plate at all. Fortunately, the dining experience was redeemed by their beer. Of course, the pilot can't drink, so I got a couple of bottles to bring home. I enjoyed them later that evening with my dinner and was pleasantly surprised at how good their IPAs were. All, in all, service times and fish tacos were not as impressive as I would have liked, though the beer kind of made up for it.",
            "Being so close to the bay, my first impression was, \" Oh no, tourist haven...\" Surprisingly, the vibe was nice. At least for lunch on a Tuesday. There was no one at the door when I walked in, but I helped myself to the bar. The bartender was really hospitable. I was feeling the kinda loud pop/edm music. She helped me around the beer menu and told me about one that wasn't on it yet, which I ended up getting. It was a raspberry blonde. Delicious. I also tried their pumpkin beer because Abby S.  raved about it on Yelp, 6 years ago. It may have changed, but it's still fire. The bartender happily gave me samples to make sure I liked a beer before getting a pint. Nice lighting in the bar area, as well as several televisions, incase you're stoping in to catch a game. Didn't have food, but the menu seemed nice. California coastal is what they call their cuisine. People seem to be enjoying themselves and it's family friendly, which is a plus. Overall, pleasantly surprised I found this costal gem while exploring highway 1.",
            "Food came literally 2 min after I ordered it. I was curious about that so I asked and the waitress said the food was made ahead of time. Was kind of warm and not that great (Saturday brunch wasn't very busy). Good beer tho had the coffee milk stout.",
            "Amazing place with an extraordinary view!Great customer service, food is great and please do not forget to save some room for dessert.",
            "We really enjoyed the service and location. The food is good and they helped us be creative to get the selections we want. Live music makes the atmosphere fun. Dog friendly on the patio was great. None of the heaters were working this time which was the only negative.",
            "The Brewing Company offers a wonderful selection of beers on tap plus large portions on the menu that can easily be split. We sat at the outside counter overlooking the harbor on a blustery day but the outdoor heater kept us warm. Order the mussels and clams with fries in a garlic wine broth for a very soothing and filling meal. Paired with a tall glass of Coffee Milk stout, a garden salad, and cup of chowder, we were indeed happy campers. Free parking in the adjacent lot.",
            "Great service.  View is great from the patio (which will have a long wait at peak times).  We got the two seats at the end of the bar that face a wall.  Eventually we upgraded our seats, but for a moment it was like the end of Blair Witch.  The food seemed overpriced about 20% and was just OK.  The clam chowder was great: the bacon was subtle and it was not overpowered by celery.  The grilled fish taco was thick and not fishy.  The fries with garlic/cheese upgrade were dry and clumped together--- might have been bad luck or sitting out too long, which I can overlook.  It's hard to fuck up fries.  However, the Mavericks Tuna Melt was named after the team in that it kinda sucks.  Sounded cool on paper  (albacore tuna salad w/ pickled ginger, fresh daikon sprouts, and apples tossed in a citrus vinaigrette) but those ingredients masked the fish taste, and there was no contrast in flavor or texture other than the bread.   Listen, being a fat d-bag with horrible fashion doesn't make me Guy Fieri--- go ahead and eat it.  I just wish it had pickles for texture or jalapeno for heat or tasted more like tuna and less like melt.",
            "Always a great view and good service at HMB Brewing Co. We started out with the grilled artichokes with balsamic and garlic aioli, wonderful flavor. The price seemed a tad steep for 1 whole artichoke seeing as it is artichoke season but I suppose it all evens out when it's out of season. Next was a cup of mushroom soup. This was to die for! I loved that there were small bits of carrot and it was finished off with a sprinkle of paprika. I enjoyed the heartiness and that it wasn't a cream based soup. The texture almost had you wanting to chew, but that would be unnecessary. I hope to have that again when I return. Veggie sandwich of deliciousness! Unsure of what kind of roll that was used as this was my hubby's selection for us to share, it was soft and flavorful but there was a layer of raw flour on the bottom that turned into paste as the juices from the sandwich pooled on the bottom of the plate. That's the only negative about this edible piece of art. I ate it and was surprised this was as wonderful as it was. I should have paid attention to the description in the menu for this sandwich as each ingredient on it added a layer of wonderful to this masterpiece. Soft roll, avocado, basil, hummus, roasted red peppers, tomato, red onion... I can't remember what else. But oh it was good!I enjoyed everything about that dining experience. I can't wait to go back again.",
            "A warm coastal California Friday afternoon - perfect for lunch on the deck at HMBBC. But along with a nice venue and good food- this is also a shout out to their management - my colleague and I are federal employees and while the government may have reopened today - we haven't been paid in three weeks and are not expecting to see a paycheck for two more weeks or maybe longer. The HMBBC management were kind enough to allow us to have lunch on them as a means of giving back to the community. We enjoyed the hamburgers and a chance to get away for a moment from wondering what was going to happen to our jobs and our savings accounts. Thanks! We'll be back to enjoy your deck again under better circumstances",
            "Disappointed with what I received, I asked to buy two mule mugs and only received one new. The other is old and used instead of showing me or telling me about the quality they just gave it me for full price.",
            "The location of this restaurant is 5 star, have a walk around the harbor, park easily and have a seat on the patio. The have fire pits and lovely views of the water across the street. Prices are typical of coastal restaurants but they bring it on size here. My favorite thing to have here are the fried artichoke hearts with garlic aioli. Yummy fried deliciousness. The raspberry frambois beer is tart and tasty. Tuesdays are trivia nights so expect a fully packed bar of locals.",
            "Eh, this place was pretty disappointing.  The views are tempting, and maybe their beers are good, but the food is nothing special.Nothing was inedible or bad, it just wasn't great food.  We had calamari to start, which was tiny prices of squid with more breading than actual meat, and we ended up only eating half. Very disappointing.For our main courses, I had the crab cake Benedict and my friend had the lump crab omelet.  I asked for no but (I try to be gluten free somewhat), and when the meal came, there was a bun. That annoys me slightly to start. But worse, my fried egg on top was totally cooked through. A fried egg should run when you cut into it, and as someone who loves eggs, this was very disappointing.  Further, the crab cake was heavily breaded and fried. Not like the lump crab cakes I'm used to in Maryland. The fries were good at least.My friend had the omelet which had more bacon than crab meat, but overall tasted pretty good.Next time, I'll go to the place across the street (Barbara's Fishtrap?) which looks better. This spot isn't worth the price tag.",
            "Met a friend in HMB. He showed us the options and we decided on this place. Usually brewing companies have decent American fare and they've got some signature dishes that always stand the test of time. We ordered appetizers and entrees and skipped dessert. The food was served in an ok amount of time and our server was ok to deal with. They've got a band area and live music was playing. They heaters on their outdoor patio where doggos are allowed. We didn't go inside, so idk how big the place is. They have fire pits outside and I'm sure the ocean views in the daytime are incomparable. Would definitely go back as we all enjoyed the food.",
            "My favorite restaurant in the Half Moon Bay area. So many options on the menu there is truly something for everyone. I have probably tried just about half of the items on the menu and it has all been fantastic. The drinks and beers are good too, and it's overall a fun atmosphere no matter if you're on the patio, bar, or inside. Favorite items I have had: fried jumbo prawns and fries (the fries are so crispy), Baja fish tacos (fish and shrimp are both super yummy), and the southwest chicken salad. Also the berry mojito has fresh muddled berry compote and is the best mojito I've had."

The inside is adorable with little modern touches, the staff is so friendly and attentive.  The food was delicious as well! I got the salmon scramble and was blown away.  It came with potatoes and an English muffin.  I added one fluffy pancake to complete my carb overload. Everything was tasty and was delivered quickly.

I went there for breakfast and it was hard to decide but I went with my usual selection: Chilaquiles and I had no regrets. We also got pancakes and they tasted very home made and delish! Portions were excellent. I had leftovers for lunch. Although the breakfast menu is pretty extensive there is also a great lunch/snack/dinner selection.",

It is a diner/coffee shop type place, which is open only for breakfast and lunch. Wait staff is very naturally pleasant.  I got a tuna melt. Tasted good, but was a little too full of tuna, making it messy to eat. As you can see from the menu, it's pretty traditional fare with some added Mexican touches, especially in the breakfast items. Service was fast.  Too early to get an accurate picture, but things were running very smoothly for an operation on only it's 5th dy",

            "I'm super confused by the poor reviews for this place, as we found the atmosphere, food and service to be excellent.    While camping at Costanoa, we decided to eat out versus cooking in our camping trailer. We made a reservation on OpenTable, walked over, and were promptly seated upon arrival.  We did get a fabulous table for 2, right in front of the fireplace.  Once seated, we ordered Brussels sprouts to start (without cheese), and they were fantastic.  We both ordered the garden salad and LOVED the dressing. It was fantastic, and the greens were crisp and fresh.  Then, for entrees I got a pasta dish and my partner got the seasonal fish.  Both were excellent, prepared very well, temperature was fantastic and timing was perfect.  We had the chocolate pudding for dessert, which was basically a chocolate mousse.  Delicious.Service was prompt, attentive and very good.  Perhaps big groups struggle here, but we were very happy with our experience.  Even better, we walked back to our camping trailer for the night, and were very content.",
            "We arrived for our reservation about 20 minutes early and was told our table would be ready in 5 minutes. No problem..not a rush!We were seated at a table where there was a bright yellow/orange stain on the paper they place on the table over the table cloth. Looking under the plate that from the top appeared freshly washed with small droplets of water, there was a huge glob of whatever that yellow/orange stuff was. So first impression, they're not doing a good job at basic cleanliness.We were moved to a table directly in-front of the fireplace. Im leaving 2 stars only because the waiter was nice but the food was sub par.We ordered a dozen oysters where at least 7 of the 12 had lots of grit and shells. We didn't finish the last 3 (which Ive never done) as the quality of the oysters we pretty poor even despite the grit and shells.We ordered the \"surf and turf\" which from the description should have been nice. But it was an oversized potato chip with a bland chopped egg topping and caviar that had no flavor and was rationed off like it was the last of it.We ordered the steak for 2 and although the waiter brought over another waiter holding the \"house accoutrement\" which ended up being sea salt, the steak was of poor quality, fatty and was medium rather than the rare we asked for. It came with potatoes that had \"some sauce\" on it but was bland. The salad it came with was good because well it was just greens tossed in a light vinaigrette (cant mess that up)Really disappointed but it was the only place open late in the evening in the area.Do yourself a favor, order a cheeseburger or something because you will not have a fine dining experience or barely a good dining experience here as my stomach felt queasy all night (I blame the sub-par oysters)",
            "We stayed at Costanoa lodge for two nights and ate at Cascade for dinner and brunch-great food and service both times!The dinner was a celebratory birthday dinner on a Thursday night and we made a reservation through Open Table. We had the steak (shared portion) which came with potatoes, green salad and a purée of some sort that was delicious. Steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly! Also came with complementary *warm* bread and butter. Wine selection wasn't large but is well curated. We had rosé and a Gamay-both excellent. Finished our meal with a sundae and moved to the bar area to watch the end of a Warriors game. The next day we had breakfast/brunch. My partner got ricotta pancakes and I got a breakfast plate with eggs, potatoes and bacon. Everything was delicious! Service was fantastic and only critique would be that the ambiance and pricing is really for a special occasion. Would be nice during the week if they had a more casual menu with lower price point. Especially at breakfast time, would be nice to have smaller (oatmeal, breakfast sandwich) or to-go items.A great gem of a restaurant and glad we got to try it during our stay at Costanoa!",
            "Highly recommend Cascade! Between the four of us, we had both the fish specials, swordfish and the Arctic Char, the rib eye and the scallops and all of it was so delicious. Presentation was beautiful, I regret not photographing. Our waiter's name was Andrés and he was so attentive and kind. The warm bread was also great. The place was busy for a cold night in March. We will definitely be coming back soon and will request to be seated in Andrés section again!",
            "Sometimes I have to be honest and it's truly to let a business know what some others might be too afraid to say. With that said...I enjoyed the drinks at the bar and Candy (the Bartender, name has been changed so no one gets in trouble) was great company and conversation. She was constantly moving and talking, good work ethic. That is nice to see. My Hubby and I ate a late lunch so we opted for the appetizer board with the roasted eggplant, beet hummus, pita chips, cucumber mint salad, falafel and olives. The hummus was good, the eggplant was also good. I love olives, so that was also good. The presentation could have been a tad prettier or better thought out. The hummus and eggplant appeared to be oozing and the chips were dusty with paprika. A little goes a long way with that spice so ease up. The cup of soup we ordered on the side, Artichoke, was nothing like we had anticipated. It was very sharp flavored and there didn't appear to be anything but artichoke in it. I let Candy know, as we dined at the bar, that the soup resembled something you would do a cleanse with after pouring it out of your magic bullet. We all had a good laugh and she was kind enough to take it off of our bill and let us know she would let the kitchen know. When I asked her if she tried it or if anyone else in the kitchen had. She advised she had not.. and couldn't speak for the kitchen. My suggestion, taste your food. I do love this place. I have had good food here and drink.. and plan on returning. I believe I was just there on an off night. See you later Cascade.",
            "Review is overdue, but we really wanted to put in our positive feedback! My husband and I ate at the Cascade two weeks ago during our stay at Costanoa Eco-resort. We planned to have dinner in Pescadero, but the road was flooded so we tried the on-site Cascade Restaurant--our good fortune! We shared a perfectly dressed salad. I had \"fish and scraps\"--which sounds a bit odd, but turned out to be a beautifully presented and really tasty combination of fresh ingredients. Nothing over-spiced, over-salted or over sauced! Perfect-sized portions. My husband raved about his seasonal fish dish as well. Reasonable prices for clean, fresh and appealingly presented plates! Andres was our very pleasant and well-informed server.Breakfast was terrific too! This is a challenging location for a restaurant. We hope it does well!",
            "The ambiance, the food, the location , the service , the scenery, the wine.... did I say the food ?Wow this place is a gem. Perfect place for a perfect date.",
            "After a hike off at Whitehouse Ridge, onto State Park Boundaries,out of Cascade farms, and down the highway 1 we we're happy to see a nice breakfast place close by!The waiter was nice, building was beautiful, and lawn area in the back is very peaceful with quails dwelling in the underbrush. There's also a huge chess set available for play but it's quite popular and was occupied during our whole 2.5 hour visit.Definitely a fun little spot to be although the restaurant is a bit pricey. Probably because of it's in-the-middle-of-nowhere location and beautiful kept land.",
            "My experience here is probably not typical. My boyfriend and I were not staying at Coastanoa; instead, we were passing through on a road trip along Highway 1. That being said, this was one of our favorite stops - perfect for a rest stop/quick bite/drinks.Plenty of indoor and some outdoor seating (great during the summer), friendly staff, and yummy bites. The duck rillettes came highly recommended and definitely did not disappoint - so rich and flavorful. Also a wonderful selection of wine given it's slightly remote location. They even had some local brews. We finished all of the little crackers that came with the duck rillettes and brie plate and asked for more. They actually ran out, so they heated up a brioche bun for us instead. Both were great with the plate we had.Favorite thing here was the human-sized chess board right outside for kids (or adults) to play on. Wizard chess anyone?",
            "Had two meals here and the food was wonderful. However, the service needs some improvement. I am told they were unexpectedly short staffed at the time of our visit. I will try it again before I rate them lower but as of right now I think the chefs deserve my 5 stars.",
            "We have eaten here several times and enjoyed every meal. The staff is friendly and helpful. We usually camp here and love that we can walk to a full service/full bar/delicious restaurant.",
            "I visited on July 3, around 6pmThey were out of several things; a beer, a wine, and tea. They could not accommodate a dish minus bacon. There were maybe four other tables seated and my meal still took 45 to arrive. My pasta was dry but floating in liquid. How?The seafood did not smell fresh nor taste it. It was very salty. They forgot pieces of meals for pretty much everyone. (Bread, fries, sauce)  Very disappointed. Can't imagine their service or selection when it's busy or in a holiday.",
            "Do check your bill. When I got my wrong bill for dinner, I thought it was purely a mistake. $2 each extra on top of our entrees. When I got another wrong bill for breakfast with some food I didn't order, I felt I could go buy a lottery ticket cause I was super lucky to get the wrong bills twice in a row. We had mixed dining experiences. Our dinner swordfish and steak were good. The cinnamon roll was the best. The breakfast French toast was too dry. Even still dry after soaked in syrup. Food came in slow. People came after us got their food and we were still waiting. Service was nice. They kept refilling our coffee. Overall it's good to see a nice restaurant serving three meals a day in a campground. But they need to improve their management.",
            "I could not echo or agree more with Tara W.'s comments regarding our experience there on July 7th.  If zero stars was an option, I would choose it.The only additional thing I will add is that I have been a longstanding Costanoa customer for the past ten years.  I have stayed in almost all the different lodging experiences, have attended weddings here, New Year Eve parties here, have had both big and small groups stay here.  Costanoa and Cascade Restaurant has been a go-to recommendation from me multiple times.  I am just so saddened and disappointed that not only the food was incredibly horrible but the communication and experience was such a shocking letdown.  If I had gotten a plate like the one that was delivered next to me after being sent back (steak still raw, cold and black and blue), someone would have needed to rush over a trash can because of my reaction.  After learning they are transitioning a new manager and new head chef, I really do wish this would have been communicated with us.  Also, I don't think while you're trying to figure all of this out, you should host a wedding and keep the restaurant open.  At this point, they are definitely not prepared for that.  There is no reason you should be putting out $30-50 plates the way you were and expect people to be happy.  I am just so disappointed and saddened that I have to write this review as this place has been such a positive staple for me for years.  I really do hope things change and people don't have to have the same horrible experience we did.",
            "A group of 12 people.Before ordering, we asked for separate bills but got a negative answer: \"too complicated\".OK let's go so we'll have 3 bills for 4 people instead and deal with it. Not an issue.There were hardly anybody in the restaurant.We ordered our food. The first dish came in at one end of the table (I was seating at the other end). My plate came in when almost everybody else had already finished their own dish...25 minutes after the first dish was served.I got my crabcakes about 40 minutes after ordering. Excellent but still frozen inside (!!)My dish was replaced (still slightly cold in the center of the cake) but unfortunately all my friend were already done with their food when my replacement was served.The staff eventually did not charge me for my dish (but $5 for the fries).Now the food:- Frozen crabcakes (could have been a solid 4 stars). $15. the most expensive dish.- Fish and chips ($12): tiny bits of fish (not a \"filet\" but several small pieces of fish, maybe approximately 8 tiny pieces on a bed of fries: 0 stars). A joke.- Fish taco ($11): hardly no fish in there, very bland and almost no seasoning.- Chicken sandwich: quarter inch chicken steak in the sandwich- 2 glasses of Malbec (red wine): $30Never again.",
            "Cas·cadekaskād/Submitnoun1.a small waterfall, typically one of several that fall in stages down a steep rocky slope.This was horrible food. We eat everywhere and never have this problem at places with entrees that are above $30.00. You have got to be kidding yourselves to claim there is a chef managing the kitchen here. I suspect you paid a chef to design a menu that was handed off to part time teenage line cooks. No way is this a chef run restaurant. What was served to us at costs of upward of $38 per entree is totally unacceptable. You are price gouging the people trapped at the resort with few options for diner.",
            "After reading some of the so-so reviews, I was worried about eating here.  But everything, from the service, to the meal, to the wonderful cozy fire was terrific. Lovely warm bread to start. The house salad with poppy and sesame seed dressing was unusual, but good. My husband and I both had the scallops and again, the flavor combinations were unique and tasty. My pana cotta dessert could've used a little more \"strawberry broth\", but was still flavorful. Our dinner was a perfect complement to a couple of great massages at the spa here at Costanoa.",
            "We had breakfast here outside in the garden. It's beautiful here and the food was tasty. Certainly recommended.",
            "Quality of the food and service has gone downhill over the past 3-4 years. Price way too high for the quality of the dinner selections. Service was slow, and as others have mentioned, getting out of there without almost having to tackle a waiter for the check is nearly impossible. I really dislike writing these downer reviews, but knowing how good this restaurant once was and what it is today made it necessary. Until the ownership rights the ship, stay away.",
            "Food was excellent and they have revamped their management as well as menu. We had the braised short ribs and abalone plate.  So delicious!  We brought our own wine and made it a very special night.  Can't beat the food there, and to think, we were \"camping.\"  Service was excellent and response time, from emailing the manager, was same day. Bottle corkage is doable and menu selection is very fresh and organic.  Great for happy hour or dinner!"

            "Soooo good!! This place has the feel of an old fashioned family diner! Don't let that fool you though, because the food is fabulous! I had perfect bacon, scrambled eggs, hash browns that were crispy and fully cooked, and the sourdough toast was delectable! Lunches are amazing too! The crab panini was full of melty hot cheese! If you go early and the waves are high you can sometimes get a great seat to watch the tourists get splashed! Everyone cheers!  There is always a pitcher of icy water with lemon on the table and they bring you your own pot of coffee! This place is a winner! Now I'm hungry.P.S. as I was leaving, I saw the chicken and waffle go by. Dude, that's what I'm having next time!!! Holy cow!",
            "Update 3/27/19I went here the other morning with my wife, this has always been one of the more decent breakfast spots in pacifica! They arent amazing but they are definately one of the best spots in town as pacifica doesnt have many good options for breakfast.I ordered the chorizo 3 egg scramble and was not really happy with it. It was dry and full of olives. Olives are my least favorite food in the entire world so it was my own fault for not checking the menu ingredients but either way it was such a weird ingredient to have. The chorizo had no flavor. There was a hair in my salsa that came with my plate  that I didn't find until i poured over my hash browns. They were very friendly about replacing them. Some places get so rude about it so i really appreciated that, i underatand accidents happen to so that wont keep me from coming back either. I just think i ordered the wrong thing for me so next time i will get something else.My wife  ordered a omelette which she loved and she highly reccomends them. I usually get the eggs Benedict. One thing i dont like that they do is leave pitchers of water out. It feels lazy and all the ice is melted at every table because they dont keep up on it when they are slow. If they are going to do that they should fill them up WHEN you get there. Breakers is a pretty good breakfast spot though and you should try it!",
            "What a great place to have some breakfast.  Easy to get seated, big portions, friendly staff and nice view of the ocean.I try to bring people who have not yet experienced this little restaurant. It safe to say no one's been disappointed.   We are leave way it's cold tummies and a big smile on our face.",
            "I never knew this place was where it was! It's kind of hidden. Hubby and I stopped by for lunch and got seated right away. Tons of options on the menu and great service! Our server was SO sweet and very attentive. The food was good, not great. It was a little on the salty side but I have yet to try other items on the menu. I'll probably come again.",
            "Happy to have found this lil local cafe! First things first, caveat -- Came on the busiest day of the year. Waited about 45 minutes for a table during lunch, and once we were finally seated, we waited about another 45 minutes for our food to come out. SAD WAIT. :(Food - Done the right way! Order any of the crepes, and you can't go wrong. I got the crab crepe with hollandaise on the side. So much crab! Well worth the $16 price tag. My husband and I also shared 2 blueberry pancakes. GO FOR THE PANCAKES. It was the most memorable. Buttery, fluffy, and with a slight crisp on some of the edges. Mmm mm. *Beware -- the menu is overwhelming, because there's so much to choose from! But it's a good thing in this case. ;)Drinks - Free coffee and water while we waited, and free coffee during our sit down! Ambiance - casual, homey, diner vibes. Service - Aside from the extenuating long wait, our waiter was attentive and quick with all other business.",
            "Went out with our team and enjoyed a brunch session. Two of us grabbed the huevos rancheros, and i thought was good. Presentation was unique, and flavor was good. It was a bit watery, but not necessarily in a bad way, just wished it was less watery. The service was great, and awesome location. Location is right near where the waves break.. get it?",
            "Such a cute little breakfast spot right next to the beach in Pacifica.  My boyfriend and I came here twice for breakfast over the weekend.  Their menu is huge and there is so much to choose from.  I had a hard time deciding what to order.  Finally I decided to get the chicken apple sausage with eggs, hash browns and toast on one day.  The next day, I ordered the grilled chicken crepe that also came with hash browns and a side salad.  My boyfriend ordered the country fried steak with eggs both days we ate there.  I literally loved everything I tried.  The hash browns were nice and crispy and the chicken apple sausage really tasty as well.  The grilled crepe was really hearty and filling.  My boyfriend loved his fried steak and eggs.  So fattening, yet so yummy!  Also no need to worry about always asking for refills on coffee and water.  Breakers provides a pitcher of water and a pot of coffee when you first sit down.  The service is really quick and efficient.  We ended up with the same server both days and he remembered us. He was really quick with our orders and the food came out fast!  There is always a wait to get a table here.  At around 10am on a Saturday, there were several people in front of us and I believe we waited around 30 minutes.  They offer complimentary coffee while you wait.  The wait is worth it and we will defiantly be back!",
            "Cozy, no fuss breakfast joint. Delicious, reasonably priced breakfast with many choices. I enjoyed the French toast with fresh fruit and my picky son very much liked his chocolate chip waffles. Friendly service and just steps away from beautiful ocean view.",
            "TLDR come if you: Want a casual and quick sit-down breakfast with lots of choices and BIG portions of different flavor pancakes or if you like lots of crab Location: Rockaway Beach, Pacifica. Right across from Nick's. Public beach parking around the corner and a good place to walk off the carbs post-meal and stare at dogsWait: 15min at 10am on a Saturday morning! A couple tables were ahead of us but there is plenty of seating and quick turnover here. Extra props for having a complimentary coffee bar and outside bench seating while you wait. Atmosphere: Casual, hustling and bustlingMenu: Large selection of almost any breakfast item you would want. So many different types of pancakes (chocolate chip, banana, pumpkin for this time of year as a special, etc.)! Also some crab selections in breakfast or a panini. Food: Crab Louis ($16) was awesome! Basically a crab eggs benedict with hollandaise. Crab was super generous like crab bae sprinkled crab all over the english muffin. Poached eggs were perfect and hash browns were crispy on the outside. Other people got hot cakes and pancakes and they were HUGE. Service: Friendly staff that stay busy running around to the many tables but still check in. I like that they give you a pitcher of water so you can help yourself. Pay upfront.",
            "This is a very special place and we clearly got lucky by arriving for a late lunch on a weekday. No line and maybe 8 tables were occupied. Service was excellent and we were pleased with our food choices: crab panini and chorizo burger",
            "This place was outstanding. Great food and waitress was very attentive and fast. Whatever we asked for came quick. Decorative casual older, well maintained dining spot. The location was right by the beach which I found pretty awesome. Variety of foods to choose from. Our order as follows:Huevos Rancheros- whole weight tortilla filled with housemade chirizo, avocado, black beans, black olives,  onions, tomatoes, cheddar, mozzarella, jalapenos,green chilies, salsa, sour cream, chives & 2 eggs with a side of hash brown ($13.69). The Sailor - Baco, spinach, mushrooms, Jack cheese, sour cream & chives ($11.15). The portions are huge, very delicious and fresh. For a first timer I must say it definitely exceeded my expectations. There is plenty of parking so no need to worry for that. So if your looking for some good breakfast this is the spot. I will definitely come back and highly recommend to family and friends.",
            "Great, no frills brunch place in Pacifica! I came here with my friend on a Sunday at around 11:30am, and this place was in full swing! Our actual wait time after we put our names on waitlist was about 15-20 min., which gave us plenty of time to look at the menu. I got the Veggie Omelette, which had cheese, zucchini, celery, broccoli, and other veggies. The dish also came with hash browns and toast (I got the sourdough). The food came out in a timely manner, and the food was delicious! My favorite was the hash browns, since I'm a huge potato fan. The omelette was good, though the broccoli was a little undercooked. The service was great too, and I can see why people love coming here for breakfast/brunch. I would definitely come back to try their other items, since they had a whole bunch of food that I'm dying to try!!",
            "Another spot we hit up almost every time we s sneak away to our beloved Pacifica. Always busy, always full of both locals and tourists. Food is pretty good; I have had a few different things. Definitely good; have also gotten takeout a couple of times and for the most part we were pleased. Have had a few issues with takeout calls...totally appreciate when they're slammed but they dont always seemed thrilled when we call for takeout. But the food has been pretty good almost every time. My better half enjoys their veggie omelet and veggie frittata a lot. Location is awesome; right by the water and if staying at the awesome Best Western Lighthouse Suites, its literally a few steps to get breakfast here. They are very busy/full often.",
            "I Wasn't Drunk, but I Stumbled Across This Place!Less than a half hour from Downtown San Francisco by highway!I almost hate to advertise it, because I don't want too many people to show up. Great atmosphere, service, and food. Spotless restrooms. Great value. Large portions, but you can walk some of the calories off by going out the front door and heading about 500 feet to the ocean. Some seats have a view of The Pacific. Arrive early! See ya there!",
            "If you're looking for a romantic breakfast or fun breakfast with friends...or a lazy breakfast on weekends...Breakers won't disappoint you at all! It's a happy fun place , loved their strawberry waffle, blueberry pancakes, huevos rancharos. Well unfortunately the options for vegetarians (no eggs) are hardly any but would def recommend you visit here for the happy vibe and hasn't browns. Egg lovers will call this place heaven",
            "Good selection of breakfast/brunch items.  The staff was very friendly and the service was fast!",
            "Awesome place for breakfast and a nice ocean view walk before & after! Been here many times and egg dishes are the go-to choices...frittatas and omelettes are a must. Hash browns are crispy on the outside and goes well with the eggs  Service is outstanding and prices are so reasonable. Parking usually easy for the area, even on the weekends when busy.Take a scenic walk after your meal to burn calories and maybe see a whale in the ocean!",
            "My buddy had opened this restaurant along with his dad and kept telling me to check it out and upon one of my visits back home, I decided to stop in and was not disappointed at all!  They have a vast menu offering so many choices for everyone and it definitely was a bit tough to decide on one thing since so much sounded amazing!  I settled on the chorizo scramble and it was awesome!  Huge portion and full of flavor meant there was not taking any leftovers.  Also tried a bit of the macadamia pancakes from my wife and they were delicious too.  Wish I had stopped in sooner when I still lived in the Bay Area, this is a gem in Pacifica!",
            "Solid breakfast place. Really good food with hefty proportions. Tends to be a little bit of a wait, but that is a sign of a good restaurant.",
            "Great spot right off the coastal highway going into San Francisco.  I had the chorizo frittatas that were fantastic. They provide you with your own urn of coffee and a pitcher of water already on the table. I recommend after eating take a short walk  down the street and enjoy the view."

            "Both sandwiches are incredible but would especially recommend the mushroom.  Onions caramelized exquisitely, great mushrooms and a surprise egg. If the weather is nice, take them to go and eat on one of the cliffs overlooking the beach (end of Redondo beach road for example)",
            "Overall decent food but not anything worth going out of the way for. They serve burgers on sandwich bread. We ordered the mushroom sandwich, beef sandwich, and house made chips. I think the chips were definitely unique and worth trying. Both mushroom and beef sandwiches were tasty, but for price and yelp reviews I expected more.",
            "Nice find.  We were headed to an Italian restaurant and then choked on the prices on Main Street. Then we found this place instead.  Its definitely not your typical luncheonette.The hubs had the burger sandwich.  It's on two pieces of toasted bread rather than a burger bun.  Different. I ordered the mushroom sandwich.  Also not what I expected.  There are full morsels of mushrooms in there - not the chopped up patty kind.  It was flavorful.  I held the aioli but can imagine how much more flavorful that would have been if the sandwich had it.  There were also either picked onions or grilled onions.  I couldn't tell.The kids mac and cheese was toddler approved.  It was just plain mac and cheese but had a smokey flavor to it. The chips again were not what I expected. They were homemade and sprinkled with some stuff on it.  Not too salty and perfectly crisp. It was good.  All in all, a fun experience.  It will add grease to your arteries, for sure.  Some folks suggested taking it to go and eating it on the beach somewhere.  That is a great idea.Extra tip:  the restrooms are in the building next door.  You need a key to get into them so you may have to ask the neighboring businesses.",
            "Much better food than I expected based on the menu.   Salad was outstanding with flower petals, fresh fennel. Mint leaves, and gorgeous magenta radish slices.  The lentil soup sounded delicious.   They were happy to to the sandwiches with extra lettuce instead of bread.   Mac and cheese had a Smokey flavor - SO good!  Maitake mushroom, egg and melty cheese sandwich was super duper.  We enjoyed getting our lunch to go and eating on the bluff overlooking the ocean.",
            "Delicious food can be found in the most unexpected places...like a hamburger sandwich in a little train car just off Highway 1 in Half Moon Bay.I didn't know where to find the best fuel for four hungry people about to embark on a giant hike to find a Christmas tree, but a friend who worked in the area did. On his word, we tried out Dad's Luncheonette, an exercise in wide U-turns and figuring out what to order from a menu late in their operating day. Unfortunately, they'd run out of the house potato chips by the time we got there, so we settled for hamburger sandwiches, mac and cheese topped with puffed-up wild rice and a white chocolate pudding featuring shards of toffee (?) brittle and an assortment of nuts. We each paid $18 or so for a burger and mac or pudding.The hamburgers -- thick beef patties, butter lettuce, red wine vinegar-soaked onions, \"Dad's sauce,\" cheese, and a runny fried egg -- are perfect as is. I always worry that special sauces won't be palatable, but whatever it was, it mixed really well with the gushing egg yolk. The mac and cheese was creamy, gooey, and warm, but we all agreed that the puffed wild rice topping was unnecessary and could've been better done with breadcrumbs or crispy cheese bits. On the other hand, the toppings on the white chocolate pudding were really special: I saw crushed edible flowers, what appeared to be roasted pumpkin seeds, a hint of orange or lemon zest and the gloriously sticky brittle. I think it elevated what was a basic white chocolate pudding to the next level.Despite the crowded interior, our food came out very quickly. I love that the stairway to the kitchen comes out into the heated interior. Dad's Luncheonette really sells the small-restaurant feeling. We didn't have a single problem with temperatures -- the pudding was properly chilled and the burgers were hot and juicy.",
            "Made a day out of going to Half Moon Bay and made sure to stop here. My wife is vegetarian and I don't really eat beef anymore so we got the mushroom burger, the mac, and the apple fritters (dessert of the day). The sandwich was really really good. My wife usually doesn't like mushrooms, but these weren't the traditional overcooked rubbery portabella mushroom, but an enoki or similar lighter type of mushroom- really good. The mac had puffed rice on top, which added a nice textural contrast. The fritters were really good too, nice and hot, perfect for the rainy weather. Worth the drive!",
            "Overall: 3/5Good service and great atmosphere, but wouldn't say it's worth the price. The inside is also a bit crowded, but I don't mind that too much.Hamburger Sandwich: 9/10Well seasoned patty, good ratio of meat-to-bread. Flavors are reminiscent of a gourmet in-n-out. Definitely worth a try, but can't justify paying the $12 again.Rose Donuts (Today's Sweet): 3/10These were fried pieces of dough with a rose sauce and lime zest. The sauce was quite tasty, but the donuts themselves were not great--tasted as if they were fried in old oil. At about $2 each, definitely not worth it.",
            "This place is the bomb! If you find  yourself around Half Moon bay during lunch, this is the place to be. The food is so unexpectedly good, simple unpretentious and fresh. Loved their herbed salad, layers of complex flavors in a bunch of green leaves. Who would've thought! Their burgers,sandwiches and meat are delectable and top notch but don't expect to find ketchup there-you won't need any anyway. One less star because they ran out of handmade potato chips and I'm still sulking.",
            "Oh my gosh. Why did I not try this place sooner! I've had dad's bookmarked for the longest time and finally got around to trying this place out last weekend. Line was out the door on Saturday, but it went by quick. I ordered the mushroom sandwich, soup of the day which happened to be celery root and apple, and the herb salad. I also got to taste a friend's side of potato chips. Everything was delicious, well balanced, and filling. Now, I'm not very adventurous when it comes to food, but after hearing the locals rave about this place I ordered as much as I could stomach.The mushroom sandwich which consisted of sautéed mushrooms, cheese, a runny egg, greens, and pickled onions in between thick buttery slices of bread was amazing. And the egg was perfect! I must admit I was a little bit skeptical about the herb salad. How can a salad consisting of just herbs not be overpowering? But it works y'all. It was delicious and the lemon dressing was so good. This is a must try! To top it off, the service was awesome. Staff was cheerful, and really personable. This place embodies what a mom and pop shop is all about. And all ingredients are local and/or organic too! Yay for supporting local farmers. Highly recommend checking out if you're in half moon bay.",
            "From the mind of former Saison Chef Scott Clark. Think \"upscale\" in-n-out. Tried their hamburger and mushroom sandwiches. Well cooked burger and met expectations. Good lunch spot if you happen to be in Half Moon Bay.",
            "Delicious!!!! Husband and I shared the hamburger sandwich. Great quality burger, will definitely eat coming back. Staff is super friendly and welcoming.",
            "Went here recently on a Friday for lunch.  It is close by my work and my colleague told me to check it out.  She highly recommended the hamburger sandwich.It was not busy when I showed up, so I got helped right away.  Ordered a coffee and their hamburger sandwich without red onion pickles (was not in the mood).  I received the burger a few minutes later, and I have to say that the burger hit the spot.  The patty was juicy and the egg was cooked right too.  Their sauce was good too.  The overall balance of the ingredients was just right and very enjoyable. It was an overcast and rainy day but that burger definitely offset the weather.  Needless to say I will be back for more.",
            "Stopped here after a bike ride with my dad on the coastal trail. It was great! My mom, sister, and I got the mushroom sandwich and my dad got the hamburger sandwich. They're basically the same with the meat swapped out for mushrooms. The best part were the fresh ingredients. I would define this place as simple lunch goodness. Nothing flavor bombing, but the essentials one would seek to fill the void after a morning on the trails",
            "Went to eat Lunch, came in and KQED Check Please! Bay Area where shooting to showcase the restaurant on TV. Anyways, I ordered there special for the day Caesar Salad w/smoked chicken, my husband has Hamburger Sandwich and the plain Mac & Cheese for the kids. I was suprised and awesomely delighted to what I ordered it was a big portion and so delicious. The smoked chicken was so tasty and juicy. The kids finished their Mac&Cheese too. I recommend everyone to go there and try their food. I loved it, will definitely come back.",
            "I can't believe we were so lucky to randomly stumble upon this amazing restaurant on on trip to half moon bay/ pescadero. It was right next to the Saturday half moon bay farmers market where we were initially there for . And when we saw a small line forming up at this cute little corner of the parking lot, we knew something was up and decided to check it out. ( not to mention, the restaurant is not even open yet). We waited maybe for 10 to 15 minutes before we started to move in to place our order.This restaurant stand on it's own on the corner of the parking lot in a converted old train. Dining in itself is a fun experience. There arent many seat inside, but a lot of people came to order take outs,  so it moves by pretty quickly. So we order their special of the day - smoked lamb ribs with zucchini noodles , thai coconut soup and their signature hamburger sandwiches oh and their homemade chips. Everything was just simply delicious and made to order fresh. You can see the chef pulling out the rack of lamb from a tin can outside the train, next to the trees , where all the smoking was happening. And once your order is ready, he came delivered right to you. It definitely have this homey, the love of food vibe.Rack of lamb- LOVE! At first we thought, how come is a little warmer than we thought, instead of steamy hot from the oven , than we started to enjoy the strong smoky tender meat. The meat was medium done and was just cooked perfect. With the delicious seasoning on the meat, every bite was just heaven. And yes I licked all the bones and strip out all the meat I can get between the tough tendons. The thai corn chowder- reminded me of the Tom ga gai.  A coconut chicken thai soup, but with more corn. It is not a thick soup like clam chowder. But it has a nice lemongrass coconut corn flavor. Very enjoyable in the chill coastal weather.Signature hamburger sandwich- my daugther loves it . Burger party with a perfect fried egg with some runny yoke and bedded with fresh greens sandwiched in nicely toast bread. Everything about it is just feel very gourmet and farm to table like. All the ingredients taste fresh and has all the flavors from just the pure ingredients itself. Moms herb chips- it was sliced thin and fried crispy with nice herb seasoning.  We were so full but took it in a cup and finished it on the way before we can get back to our car. It is probably the highlight meal of my weekend trip to pescadero, sf and half moon bay. I cant wait to come back again!",
            "Best burgers on the coast! The owner's positive energy is contagious, the passion shows through his work.",
            "This was so amazing! Unfortunately, they were out of a lot of things when we got there but wow the hamburger sandwich was amazing. The  food was super tasty  for a quick grab and go. Totally recommend!",
            "One Liner: Amazing, quirky restaurant serving classic bbq fare unlike you've ever tasted. Full Review: we've been here a few times and the menu is always different. However we've never been disappointed. The burger, sandwiches, salads, desserts... everything is unlike anything you've had at a classic burger joint and SO good. Its truly amazing what they do out of this old train car. If you're in the area, skip everywhere else for lunch and go to Dads.",
            "Come early, it's worth it. We arrived with 10 minutes to spare before the doors opened. Scott and his partner were inside prepping for what I can only assume was the calm before the storm. As the third people in line, by 11 the line was 15 or so deep. This place only seats about 10 people inside. Don't worry! They do to go orders.We pretty much purchased one of everything on the menu, fair pricing, great music and Scott and Alexis are really the kindest people. The food came out quick, within minutes- they are personal and call you by name. Makes it feel like we're friends from the get go. The food is visually beautiful. Sandwiches are cut in half, the homemade chips are served in paper sack, mac n cheese is dressed with green onions and a puffed rice and the soup comes in a little plastic container topped with lemon zest, micro greens and green onions. I went with the mushroom sandwich which definitely didn't disappoint. It was as if the mushrooms married some butter and made the most delicious marriage! Seriously, mushrooms cooked to submission in butter-DONE! All I can say, it was a pleasant surprise, little hole of a restaurant. I'll be back, that's a promise.",
            "Absolutely adorable trailer/truck type setup for the physical space, and AMAZING food as well! If you live in the Bay, this is definitely worth the quick drive to a random-ish part of Half Moon Bay.We got the burger, mac 'n cheese, homemade potato chips, and herb salad. Everything was literally incredible. I don't like burgers very much, but the fresh and perfectly seasoned burger patty was exactly what I needed. My favorite sides were the mac 'n cheese, which came topped with puffed rice for a bit of an added crunch, and the herb salad, which was tangy and a good palate cleanser for the other dishes. Except for the salad, everything is quite rich; while not dripping in grease, you will definitely be feeling it for the rest of the day. I'd recommend coming on a weekday. Coming on a Thursday afternoon, we had no line, got our food very fast, and didn't have to worry about them running out of food. Given the tiny space (of about 10 seats total), I can only imagine how crazy this popular place can be over the weekend!"

            "Five warm and ecstatic stars.Traveling from San Francisco to the aquarium in Monterrey, we happened upon this charming coffee shop. Two fun, friendly young women behind the counter introduced my kids to the joy of Italian soda (they loved the strawberry!) and my daughter declared the bagels \"as good as New York!\" My husband and I feasted on fresh pastries on the lovely ocean-front deck and my iced coffee was dark and delish. Take a moment to enjoy the luxury of simple pleasures and give Here Comes The Sun a try!!--Katy Regnery, New York Times Bestselling Author",
            "Tiny spot on the side of the road. Free parking. Clean bathrooms. And oh so tasty coffee! The patio is very relaxing with a nice view over the ocean. If you are looking to grab coffee somewhere, this is the place. But I'd encourage you to grab-and-lounge on the patio rather than grab-and-go.",
            "VERY RUDE SERVICE FROM THE MALE BEHIND THE COUNTER WITH RED HAIR. I am a local coastie and had never tried Here Comes The Sun. This morning when I was headed to a walk for people affected by a rare disease and decided to stop for some coffee on the way. I asked a question about the sizes of the cups and coffee that they served. Despite these being a normal new costumer question and despite me asking in a polite, friendly manner, I was met with extreme attitude. The man with the red hair acted as if I had horribly wasted his time, ignored my question, and was very irritated he had to sell me coffee. Not surprisingly (since he ignored me and was arrogant), he picked up the wrong size cup. When I pointed out that I wanted a different size (the one I was physically pointing at while asking the question he ignored), he became even more annoyed and barked \"what size DO you want?\" I paid for my coffee in silence. When I proceeded to ask only 1 additional question (where is the dark roast?), the amount of attitude I received from him escalated. I calmly explained that it was my first time at the coffee shop and asking a few questions was not unreasonable. Don't come here since I would hate for you to waste this man's time purchasing coffee at a coffee shop!",
            "Best coffee I've ever had! This is a gem hidden in humble yet adorable little coffee shop. We had a chocolate mocha and a hot chocolate steamer. Get it and drink it hot. Kind and friendly service.",
            "LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Awesome atmosphere! A very happy place! You can just be lazy on one of couches and read a book. They have a little library just in case you may forget yours. Coffee is delish and pastries yummy. My son and I chilled outside on their patio for a bit and he played guitar. The cafe's guitar. He was ecstatic when he saw it there. He even tuned it. We visited on Sunday morning and today. The same lovely cashier was there. She's a very happy and lively person. She makes your day come alive and you can't stop smiling! We will stop by every time we drive that way. Can't wait to have their coffee again! So yummy! They have an awesome ocean view as well.",
            "Open early, friendly service, delicious mocha with a leaf on top and regular coffee good without any additions.  Funky atmosphere and great view!",
            "Totally packed on a day when the power was out for thousands in the area. What a warm, friendly cafe. Lots of places to sit. Cozy and homey. The gal running the place even did a little dance in the middle of the room because she was so happy how full it was. She was herself, joyful, and not concerned with her vulnerability in the moment. How beautiful. Highly recommend. Oh, the coffee is great too!",
            "Really liked this spot and stayed for a while. I did a bunch of good work even though the WiFi was on the slow side. The barista was friendly but new as the owner came in to check later. So I have to come back when the regular folks are there to give the coffee a true test. Barista tip: push down harder on the grinds, and/or make them finer before pulling a shot otherwise the latte tastes like bad drip coffee because the water/steam flow is too fast and there is little flavor. The pastry was fresh and tasty. I'll be back some time I think. Should have been 3 stars but benefit of the doubt till then. Bottom line: can't recommend the coffee today.",
            "If you have not met Amber, (the wild and fun gal whom owns \"here comes the sun\" coffee shop) or stumbled into the coziest and coolest coffee shop of HWY-1, then you need too! I first started getting coffee here when I was teaching part-time in half moon bay and took the 1 instead of the 92. --I now live/work in Montara (2+ years), down the street from the coffee shop and have gotten to know everyone. It's my weekly go to, hang out, and the dog loves it too. The shop is really at its best year yet, with a new sign, organization, decor and HCTS merchandise, you can't go wrong! But the coffee...fresh locally roasted artisan coffee from \"Oakwood Coffee Roasters\" in Oakland, CA. these roasters care about the quality of their beans and their coffee shops they supply. What's great is you can try the: medium, Dark, French, and decaf as amber brews those on drip all day and keeps them fresh. You can try the espresso too off the bar. I like an almond milk latte or cafe ole', and let's not forget about the delicious pastries....from classic, to seasonal, gluten free, vegan, bagels, and fresh donuts, Amber and her crew has got you covered. So stop on in, because you it's on your way to work or the beach, or maybe your just exploring the coffee shops in the Bay Area, this is one is not to be missed.

I didn't even drink the coffee I just threw everything away because I was so disgusted with him touching everything. He kept twitching and talking to himself I never had such a bad experience. I read good reviews about this place but I had one of the worst experiences. I will NOT be coming back EVER.",
            "The friendliest coffee place around.  Amber is a delight - worth going there just to see her friendly face but of course its about the coffee too.  I\"ve never had a mediocre coffee here.  This is one of the coziest friendly places to enjoy coffee and bagels etc...There is a nice patio outside with rustic appeal.  Easy access just off Hi1 in Montara.If you are looking for an independent coffee house with a great experiance this is it!  Thanks Amber for being your sunny self!",
            "Know that this review reflects an unusual occurance at Here Comes the Sun Coffeehouse, but today I experienced a burned bagel along with the lack of the regular amount if topping normally provided on the bagel.  All this happened due to the staff being distracted, and the owner not planning planning for supplies depletion. Thankfully the rest of the experience was the  tasty happy day with coffee excellent, and the sun blazing across the ocean providing a view matched by few other places in the world.  Michael and Chris behind the counter we're cheery.  So was Amber.More stars next time if the bagel service recovers.",
            "Very friendly staff who make you feel at home. It's the kind of place where everyone will know your name and say hi if you come often. They got good coffee and do fun events for kids and sometimes have music nights. Good times in the best town in California!",

Well, it'll be all right if we don't bomb North Korea or piss off most of Europe. I've buzzed by this bright yellow house on Highway 1 on my way to Half Moon Bay and all points south. It's in Montara just south of Devil's Slide and quite close to the ceviche and pisco sours at La Costanera. This coffeehouse is barely two rooms where in the main parlor, they serve the standard caffeine choices, hot chocolate, Italian sodas, and Mighty Leaf tea, as well as some edibles like bagel sandwiches and baked goods that are left in the pink bakery boxes on the counter.There's a side room that's more like a walk-in closet with a big window, a comfy-looking sofa, and an obvious regular who appeared to be parked in there with his laptop for the day. \"Dream until your dreams come true\" is what's inscribed on the wall, words to live by as you're sipping your macchiato and writing the Great American Novel. Me? I just wanted to get a $2.50 cup of the Mighty Leaf Chamomile Citrus Tea to warm my bones and take it out to the glass-enclosed patio where I could watch the cars zip by as the bright blue sky melts into the deeper blue of the Pacific (photo: bit.ly/2oan0RL).Sun, sun, sun, here it comesSun, sun, sun, here it comesSun, sun, sun, here it comesSun, sun, sun, here it comesSun, sun, sun, here it comesTEA - 4 stars...lovely cuppa tea to sip out on the patioAMBIANCE - 4 stars...hard to beat the gorgeous ocean view on a sunny daySERVICE - 3.5 stars...friendly and there to serveTOTAL - 4 stars...the relaxing setting is the attraction here",

I indulged with two medium nonfat lates to which I added cinnamon. Also purchased a fresh chocolate croissant and blueberry scone. This is a dog friendly place and had a a couple of nooks to the left and right of the coffee bar where two people were happily serving you.  To the left was a reading room with books and games available for your reading pleasure or child to keep him or her occupied.  To the right led a door to an outdoor patio nook with little potted plants surrounding the area.  On the shelf were locally knitted woolen beanies for sale, which I thought very unique and pretty good idea given the cool climate.  This place is so charming and I was very glad to discover it.",

            "It was only Monday morning and I ran out of coffee at home. I was also craving bagels. I didn't have time to go to the grocery store. I drive by Here Comes The Sun every morning and I hadn't been there for a while. So, I decided to get my morning coffee and a bagel to satisfy my immediate caffeine and breakfast needs :).I have no idea why I gave this cafe three stars before. It is such a cute little coffee shop and now I'm going to go here all the time! Five stars all the way!They are fast in the morning, which is busy of course. And they are so friendly! I ordered a plain bagel with cream cheese, lightly toasted and it hit the spot! In fact, I went two mornings in a row earlier this week because I enjoyed the coffee and bagel so much. Just writing this makes me want to get a soft bagel....mmmm....There is a cute outdoor seating area that is dog friendly by the way, and I can't wait to go there on the weekend to get some work done with my dog. Inside, it has that 1990s cute local coffee shop feel complete with items for sale by local artists, an area that sells CDs by local musicians (how much more 90s can you get than that?!), and the sweetest little artsy notes all around the shop. I think there is a note written over a mirror that says something like, \"you are beautifully and wonderfully made.\" Awwe! That love stuff gets me.No more Starbucks for me. Here Comes The Sun, do do do do, Here Comes the Sun, and I say, it's alright...",

            "Half Moon Bay really needs a great seafood restaurant, which is what PPFH aspires to be. We are rooting for them, and we were encouraged by our first visit. It took a few minutes for them to seat us, as they are understaffed and a new restaurant. Maybe 5-8 minutes. After we were seated, we ordered the mussels and frites, an abalone slider, and the cod fritters (or bolinhos de bacalhau, as they wrote it in Portuguese). All three were delicious! Before our food arrived, we were feeling a bit annoyed about the slightly long wait to be seated, but the quality of the food erased those feelings.For dessert, we had New Orleans-style beignets, with chocolate, strawberry and condensed milk (or white chocolate?) toppings. Two thumbs up.I hope they can hire more staff, because that seems to be the missing piece of the puzzle. The food is great, so please don't change that!",
            "Had a couple steaks, one with mashed potatoes and one with garlic bread, a Caesar salad and a butterleaf lettuce salad. Everything was cooked perfectly as requested and tasted fantastic. The service was also amazing. Maybe we got lucky, but I couldn't have asked for a better experience.P.S. the beignets are to die for",
            "Stopped in today to enjoy a break in the rain on the outside patio. Enjoyed a beautifully presented cup of artichoke soup which was piping hot and delicious. I prefer a vibrant artichoke flavor and light, but not overwhelming creaminess and this dish fit the bill. Shared an order of \"nachos\" with ahi, edamame and pineapple on wonton crisps. I didn't think I would like the pineapple but it was the perfect compliment. The ahi was fresh and the dish thoughtfully prepared. I would probably order the poke next time instead to stave off the heaviness factor of the nachos but that is just preference. The service was excellent- attentive and informative. The menu is extensive which made for a hard time choosing. Would be okay with less choices, but again, preference.Definitely will return and encourage friends and neighbors to visit and support our newest restaurant.",
            "Been looking forward to this place to open and it's finally here!  We stopped by for a late lunch and had crab cakes, abalone sliders, garlic fries and Mac & cheese.  Everything was well prepared, seasoned and fresh.  The crab cake had lumps of fresh crab and came with a creamy aioli.  The garlic fries were curly thick cut with fresh garlic and parsley, fried to crisp.  The kids mac & cheese was creamy and had sprinkles of shaved bacon.  The only complaint I have is the sliders.  The abalone slices were too small, barely made a \"patty\" and you can't taste it between the bread and slaw.  And it was $22 for 3...  Since it's advertised as an abalone focused restaurant, I hope they can step up their game.I'll give it another shot in a couple months, I hope it gets better...I do love abalone.",
            "So sad...  the service is the worst, ever. Waitress took our order, another waitress came back to confirm it. Everything took forever to arrive, and was like warm. I had to go to the bar to ask for a second beer while I waited 45-minutes for our entrees to arrive - bartender wouldn't serve me. Waited another 15-minutes for a beer. Artichoke soup tasted like lemon-flavored mud. Wasn't served with toppings as described on menu. Salmon was served way too on the raw side (and I like mine medium...). The bowl (not cup) of abalone soup we ordered had four pieces of abalone in it. The guy behind the sushi bar was hustling, not nearly the service nightmare in the dining area. One and done.",
            "Enjoyed the food, will be patient with the service, but will definitely plan on coming back in a few weeks.  Ate the following:Hawaiian Nachos -solid plate but probably too much aioli for me... some spots of roe or a contrasting flavor could heighten the dish (ginger or shiso?Calamari - menu said ..\"and peppers\" so I was hoping the peppers were chopped up and fried with the calamari and fried similar to Betelnut in SF.  Abalone Chowder - good soup, chunks of abalone. Understandably a cup of abalone will only have a few pieces of abalone as each \"steak\" has a high cost. For $7 it should be understandable. The three piece abalone special at Bella Vista is/was $75.Assorted butter lettuce salads ordered at the table seemed fine...Fish taco plate - two a la Carte tacos on flour tortillas. Solid flavor. Would love something on the side such as beans or fries, will order if available next time. Probably the best thing I ate.Dessert - had the apple tart and the beignets, both were good. Creme anglaise could be a little thicker for dipping the beignets.It's clear the restaurant recently opened as there were some minor technical difficulties as can be expected with a new restaurant, but the food tasted good and I'll be back.",
            "Celebrated my birthday here and had a great time! Everyone was nice and the location and views are awesome. Menu is creative and the portions are big. I really enjoyed the abalone sliders, oysters, and crab cakes. Will be coming back!",
            "Came here with my boyfriend on a beautiful sunny day a few weeks ago and it was delish! We ordered the garlic fries, Hawaiian nachos and oysters. The garlic fries came out hot and crisp and really liked the unusual shape! Nachos were also good but the oysters were to die for - beautiful presentation!Service was OK, you could tell they were still learning the menu but overall wasn't a major issue.Can't wait to come back!",
            "Came here for our 17 wedding anniversary dinner. We were seated promptly and we were  offered something to drink. We got our sodas, and the lady said she was going to go find a waiter to take our order. 1/2 hour later, we still had not had our order taken. During that 1/2 hour of waiting, another larger group had been seated near us. Waiter came and took their drink orders, and a few minutes later, came and began to take their orders. At that point, we got up and started to walk out. As I walked past the waiter, I  said,\" we have been waiting 1/2 hour for our order to be taken\" all he said was \"I'm sorry and continued to take the other tables order\"",
            "Service was A+ for us. Friendly, attentive without being intrusive and efficient. We are rooting for this place to thrive. We had the abalone ceviche appetizer and it was delish. I had the salad with wasabi dressing and it was bland a I couldn't taste any wasabi. Husband had the chowder and it was nothing special. It's new and has kinks to be worked out and we will try it again. Everyone was so nice",
            "Came here on Saturday, 2pm. Only 3 other tables, two which had eaten. Ordered fish tacos and the Chirashi  bowl. It took 20 minutes from the time we ordered for the Chirashi bowl to show up. Good quality nigiri. Shrimp tacos showed up at the 40 minute mark, at which point we had decided to leave. Service is super slow. The perception is that they are very disjointed. From the waitresses to the food runners to Sushi chef, not much connection or direction. No leadership around overseeing the operation either. Would not recommend this to anyone looking for efficient, timely service.",
            "Weekend getaway looking for something close to the hotel to walk to for dinner. Pleasantly surprised with friendly staff and good food. The Abalone Chowder was great had a rich creamy flavor. The Abalone dinner had great flavor and a nice presentation. Only down fall was the size of the Abalone medallions.  The shrimp dinner with mashed potatoes was spot on. Tender shrimp full of flavor with a tomatillo sauce. It doesn't sound like the two belonged together but a great combination. I would definitely dine here again.",
            "The food wasn't bad but the experience seemed odd, I know they just opened but we couldn't get a cup of coffee, they couldn't find the coffee.  I found the room uncomfortably cold and our deserts came about 5 minutes apart.  I felt like the whole thing was a struggle for them, they kept apologizing for the 'kinks' they were trying to work out, which was awkward.  Hope they can figure things out, today's was a fairly expensive meal but not an especially pleasant experience.  Our server was very nice, I think the challenges were beyond her control.",
            "My boyfriend and I anxiously awaited the opening of this restaurant because we love abalone and seafood in general.  We had the abalone sliders, the crab cakes, and the garlic fries.  The food was fresh and tasty.  However, there was too much bread with the abalone sliders, masking any taste of abalone.  The crab cakes were OK.  This judgement comes from someone who grew up eating Maryland crab cakes, which no place else can equal in my opinion.  The garlic fries were nice and crispy, but there wasn't much garlic taste.  The service was friendly and attentive.  Despite any negative comments here, I highly recommend you give this place a try if you like seafood.  It's definitely a step above other seafood restaurants in the area."

            "Super good food!...great selection of coffee and tea!..friendly faces! I highly recommend this place!",
            "This logo is so cute! Love the grilled cheese pic. This is a small local shop. They're not very speedy. We ordered 3 meals. Pancakes, something else, and an artichoke wrap. The pancakes were large and tasty! The artichoke wrap was not very good. The breakfast potatoes would've been good had they been warm. And I honestly can't remember the last item, it was my husbands. He ate it all so I imagine it was good. Overall the ladies were friendly. The service was slow. And the food was mediocre. Go with the pancakes and you'll be all set!",
            "Disappointing food. Nothing special about the potatoes, on the greasy side. Bland omelette. Small flat biscuit was flavorless. Hoped for real jelly, but there were only those plastic squares of corn syrup jellies. A star for terrific coffee, several choices, and another for a table near photos of local whales and surfing.",
            "Will never stop in here again.I dropped in here on a whim while on our way to the HMB Pumpkin Festival. I was a bit hungry and wanted to get something to eat before arriving at the festival. It was around 10ish when I stopped in. The fam stayed in the car while I dropped in to place an order to go. There was a line as expected, but it moved fairly fast. Upon ordering at the front register with a young girl, I inquired about two different items on the menu and one particularly, the breakfast burrito. She immediately copped an attitude and took the menu and read to me and said \" It has what it says it has \" I looked at her and served her the attitude right back and told her it was not specific with certain things, because breakfast burritos usually come with hash browns inside  hence the reason I asked. I ended up just ordering the burrito and told her what I didn't want on it that it said it comes with...well, to serve my purpose for questioning what comes on it, the \" Ranchero sauce \" that they say comes on it, no longer is added on it \" Well, my dear, THATS WHY I ASK QUESTIONS \". It also comes with home fries which I opted out on. $13.00!!? Anyhow, it then took over a half hour to get, and while waiting to get my food, I begin to notice more and more how dirty the place was. AND, to top it, One of the two young girls that was working the iPad/register ( handling cash and cc) Went to go prepare a person's bagel without washing their hands...AND her nails were super dirty!! Yuck! I FINALLY got my burrito and was almost hesitant to eat it, but was starving. The burrito was decent though not spectacular and certainly not good enough to return.Kept thinking about how my burrito was prepared for the rest of the day and just prayed that I didn't get sick...a restaurant should leave you questioning such things. Never again.",
            "Great spot for a morning coffee and avocado toast where you can relax before heading to the beach. Love that they have alternative milk options and plenty of seating looking into gorgeous HMB scenery",
            "My boyfriend and I were quite disappointed with this place. The location is cool but other than that everything else sucked. Food wasn't great, service/employees.. let's just say weird. There were little bugs everywhere, tables were dirty. We had the worst mimosas ever so yeah never coming back here. Total waste of money",
            "This place was terrible. It smelled like Dew rag. Flies around everywhere inside. My food was also very bad I would not recommend this dump to anyone.",
            "Last time at the pressI just picked up my sandwich and took it home. You guys put less and less fries. Sandwich was just smashed and looked terrible. I was extremely dissatisfied. Worst of all is that when I called to talk about it someone just hanged up on me.",
            "This place had such a cute exterior and atmosphere, with just the right kind of beach side lunch vibes I wanted, but it was a let down.First, this place advertises itself as a grilled cheese place, which was the reason I pulled over to try it out. Their take on a grilled cheese is utterly disappointing. The cashier didn't know the menu and had to read off of it, unfamiliar with their own offerings. The sandwiches came out and were cold. Most of the cheese wasn't melted and the bread was soggy and greasy. If this is your specialty, it needs to be the best around and this definitely wasn't. My order came with a salad, not fries like I had requested and there are no choices for dressings listed anywhere, nor are there options to have it tossed in your salad and not on the side. I can't speak for their coffee or breakfast menu, but a huge let down in the grilled cheese department. Keep driving past this place.",
            "I've only been here about three times, but every time the staff is unreasonably rude which really just makes me not want to come back. The food is good, but the staff is weirdly sassy and unpleasant. I work in a cafe too so I make it a point to be a friendly customer when at other food establishments. I know how some customers can be. Yet, in return I always get short and sometimes rude answers/comments from the staff. Wonder why the staff is always unpleasant...",
            "Food is great, but order at your own risk. The people working behind the counter yell at you if you don't make everyone in your party order under 1 number. They slam coffee mugs at you and give you attitude if you ask where to pick items up. I talked to management who did nothing about it. Of all the cute places to grab breakfast in HMB, this kind of ridicule is not necessary. Don't start your morning here!",
            "Friendly staff and yummy food sums up The Press. I had the lunch special - smoked mozzarella with cherry tomato and arugula grilled cheese sandwich with tomato basil soup and it was filling and fresh.Slightly expensive and lacks comfortable seating of a cafe if you like to hang out in the cafe to read a book.",
            "Honestly this has to be my favorite coffee shop in California. Not only do they have great coffee but they also have great food. The family run business is exactly what I like on the coast. They take pride in everything they do and you can see it by the way they smile when you walk in the door.",
            "This place is almost unbearably adorable. Freshly baked goods and farm-to-table hearty meal offerings ranging from avocado toast to huevos ranchos to mac n' cheese (grilled cheese is a signature dish). Seating is both indoor and outdoor. It's a community hub - and despite the limited hours, this place is almost always packed. Coffee is great, food is great, ambience is great. Five stars!",
            "Best breakfast and lunch spot on the coastside. Worst server on the coast. The baker who makes the burned pastries is the worst kind of white privilege, she makes you feel cold and unwanted the second you walk in as she fixes her shit eating stare. Every white customer in front of me and behind me gets regular treatment, Brown person walks in.....you're getting condescended to, eyes rolled at if you're lucky, ignored at best.The owner has done great to ingratiate himself with the locals, he's built a great rep slowly and smoothly. Shame he's totally blind to the burned croissants and the rude entitled under performing baker who grinds her white privilege into your coffee while wishing death upon you.",
            "Stopped by this cute little place yesterday on a motorcycle ride down the coast. It's small and cozy and can fit quite a bit of people. They have an outdoor patio area and inside seating as well. You order at the counter right when you get in. We ordered the artichoke spinach omelette and an oatmeal with mixed fruits. To drink, we got one fresh squeezed orange juice and a cup of coffee. The omelette was filled with artichokes and sausage. It was also a pretty decently size portion. Super tasty. The potatoes were awesome and the dish came with a small plain scone. We didn't really eat much of the scone and actually gave it to a sweet dog named Lily to the table next to us. The oatmeal was cooked perfectly and came with a splash of milk and some brown sugar for mixing. There was a good amount of banana, apples, and strawberries. Nothing to complain about the food was great and hot and filling! I highly recommend getting the oj. The coffee is from Peerless which I really like, but they need to do a better job of keeping the pots full! Hawaiian Kona blend was delish.",
            "Good food and nice decor. Al fresco dining option.  Staff is nice & friendly decent prices. Would like a more 'hip' coffee, but it was good enough.",
            "Came on a Saturday morning around 10. The food is ok but they were out of bagel, they mixed up the order of my gf which was pressed bagel. Ordered it without cheese, it was missed and the first time they ey served was with cheese. After wating for 25 mins, got a flavor of the pressed bagel, scrambled eggs on soggy toast. When it came out please refer to the photo which they offered. I would not recommend!",
            "We really enjoyed our late lunch here - it's a good place to stop after the beach or a hike! I got the Cubano, which was tasty, and my friend got the chicken and waffles - I'm not a big fan of waffles but the chicken was great! The prices seemed a little high. They have a nice seating area outside. We'd probably try this place again if we're in the area!",
            "Loved everything about this place. I'm from the east coast and avocado toast is not really a big thing there so I thought I'd try it. Great! Just a little spice that made it interesting and the bread was great. Loved that they made good coffee as well. Great view while eating breakfast and the service was quick. This was a great spot before heading out to the beach to whale watch!"

            "Do you like sticks?Do you like Steam?Well if you answered \"yes\" to both questions, then Stick and Steam is the place for you!...lol I'm stupid.This is a very small restaurant - came here on a Thursday around 1:00PM and it was a full house, so I can't imagine the wait on a weekend. Heard that a relative of the owner of Koi Palace opened this spot - and I notice that their XLB's are pretty similar! Salted Egg Yolk Fries: sounds delicious, but wasn't very impressive. I expected it to be extremely flavorful and packed with salted egg yolk, but it was very mild. Pretty good though if you just tell me they're regular fries lolSkewers:-Pork Belly: super fatty and melt-in-your-mouth good. The meat part was a tiny bit too tough for my liking but it's really good for what it is. The flavors were all there.-Chicken Wings: BOMB! I highly recommend getting this! Tasted liKe sweet soy wings -Chicken Cartilage: not your typical chicken cartilage - this one reminds me of the chicken knee skewers that I love getting in Japan, except this one had teriyaki sauce on it and I very much prefer salt & pepper. Very fatty pieces of cartilage (except it's a bit too sweet for me)-Chicken Heart: it came out looking dry but it was surprisingly soft and tasty! If you're a heart lover I recommend thisXiao Long Bao: same ones from Koi Palace. Super juicy and delicious.Hainanese Chicken Rice Plate: BONELESS CHICKEN? Sign me up!!! Pretty decent Hainan Chicken with yellow rice and the bombass ginger/scallion sauce! I thought it was pretty good, but the portion is on the smaller end. I'd definitely recommend ordering appetizers/skewers to go with this so you can leave full and happy.Kumquat Lemon Green Tea: just tasted like regular lemon green tea to me, didn't have a kumquat \"punch\" to it. Requested for less sweet and it was perfectly refreshing.",
            "My wife and I went there early on a Thursday and waited for the doors to open. Ordered the lamb skewer, chicken wings skewer, pork belly with charcoal bun combo as well as 1/2 Hainan chicken.  Not a lot of food for the money. Service was attentive and efficient though.Best dish was the Hainan chicken, followed by 4 grilled pieces of pork belly. The rest was ordinary. Maybe next time we will try something else on the menu.",
            "Their signature main dish is the Hainan chicken with rice. The chicken was okay but the rice was not the best I've had. Mediocre.They also have grilled skewers. Pretty extensive menu with a lot of asian snacks. We also had the Xiaolongbao and Siumai. Both were okay.Price was affordable.Service was kinda lack tho. They just deliver the food and bring you the check. Didn't ask if we need water until we asked for it.Will try something else on my next visit.",
            "Location right next to bart, so you can grab dinner on the way home. A twist on your traditional Dim Sum items. Staff was friendly and food came out relatively quick.Must try: Typhoon Ha Gao, Hainan Chicken, Sea Bas Collar (on the pricey side), Pork Belly with Charcoal buns, and Bacon wrapped shrimp.",
            "Nice place to get either small bites or a full meal. Located in the same plaza as in and out.they have a shared parking lot with other places as well.Customer service was fast and friendly. They are also pretty attentive at refilling your water and removing empty plates to make more space.As for my order I have tried most of the items since I visited this place twice. My favorite out of all them are the egg fries and teppan dumplings. I have also tried the steak skewers, which were ok. Beef noodles was also yummy, very tender meat. Noodles were alright. Overall food was good, some better than the others of course.Definitely recommend due to great service.",
            "A new addition to Millbrae's Asian restaurants, Stick and Steam proves to deliver quality food and service. SERVICE 5/5: The staff here are both attentive and friendly. No issues here!FOOD 5/5: By the time I wrote this review, I have tried Stick and Steam multiple times and never been disappointed. My favorite dishes are house pot stickers, typhoon ha gao, Hainan chicken, and salted egg fries! Don't forget to grab a passionfruit aloe drink to go along with your meal. It's better than some of the local boba shops!OVERALL 5/5: I'm glad that places like Stick and Steam are arriving to Millbrae. It's a fresh take on Asian food while maintaining the essence of traditional food. Definitely looking forward to my next visit!",
            "Came by for dinner the other night and it was a mediocre experience. Parking is available in their private lot or on the street. Service was okay, albeit a touch bizarre, with the oddest being their tipping suggestions at 18%, 20%, 25% or other?!?Started off with the half Hainan chicken which was mediocre. The chicken was okay but on the bland side. The couple sides of sauces did help.The spicy chicken roulette was also ok. The chicken wasn't the best, although the spicy sauce did have a nice kick to it!The xlb trio was surprisingly decent with super thin skin, plenty of soup inside the dumplings, along with a vinegar dipping sauce.The typhoon shelter shrimp dumplings were merely okay. After lightly frying them, the skin tasted off...There must have been some mix up inside the kitchen as the last two items took a good reminder before they came out...seems like they were dropped off at the table next door?!? ...so much for requesting 18%+ service charge?!?The highlight of dinner had to be their salted egg yolk fries. They were hot and fresh. The salted egg yolk was a marvelous add-on to the fries.~$33/head after tax and gratuity for dinner.",
            "Pretty solid place for some Chinese fusion food. We ordered the hainan chicken with rice and kimchi fried rice. Also had the XLB trio and some skewers. The truffle XLB was my favorite. The skin was just the right thickness, holding in all the soup. It was so flavorful and aromatic. We also ordered the pork belly with charcoal buns. Definitely worth a try. The fat to meat ratio on the pork belly was well balanced. The charcoal bun balanced out with the savory pork belly. This place is worth checking out. We will be back!",
            "Good place to get a quick bite before getting on a lane at SFO if you are not in the mood for In and Out. The XLB was the best. Some improvements would have been to make the beef noodle soup noodles a little less cooked and make the chicken rice a little fresher to get to five stars.Dinner* Beef Noodle Soup (Good)* Hinanese Rice Plate (Good)* XLB trio (Very Good)",
            "My girlfriend and I tried out Stick and Steam for the very first time on a Saturday around 6pm. We were greeted right away waited at the entrance for just a few minutes before we got assigned our table. The menu is very easy to understand. You can pretty much mark down what you want to order numerically. So, things can't really go wrong. They have a nice drink menu on the side and the skewers look like they would go well with the beer and somecompany.My girlfriend, also wanted a jasmine hot tea, and they were able offer it for us. Even though, it wasn't on the regular menu.Since it was only my girlfriend and I, We ordered 4 things: beef noodle, chicken rice, pork skewers plate, and egg fries. They were all delicious, and it didn't take very long until the food arrived to us. The food here feels very clean and fresh. The service was excellent. The portion is definitely well worth the price. The shop isn't big, but the atmosphere, and how things are set up look very professional. You can even see the cook making food behind the clean glass! That's pretty cool! We'll definitely be back and highly recommend this place to our friends and family.",
            "Omg! I honestly didn't expect much coming to this place as it is a fusion restaurant, but some items were pretty good and that blew my mindHouse potstickers tasted pretty authentic, so that surprised me. Typhoon hagao was a deep fried hagao (shrimp dimsum) with some fried toppings on top. This was delish! I usually don't like hagao because of the skin, but since it was deepfried, I actually liked it. And it wasn't too oily, always a plus. Enoki beef rolls skewers were just whatever. Would not get it again as it's expensive for 3 tiny little things. Not worth. XLB trio was decent. Definitely not the best XLB I ever had, but it's decent for a fusion place! They still had a good amount of soup in them compared to other places. Service was not great in my opinion. As my friend took the last XLB the waiter came swiftly to take the plate away.. with the sauce that my friend did not get a chance to dip.. the table next to me was getting some last bits of onions on the plate and the waiter just stood next to her WAITING for her to finish so he can get the plate. How awkward is that? Also, they forgot about one of our skewers. So yeah service is not on par.",
            "This place is like a Chinese fusion tapas place. Salty egg fries -  sorry, I'm Chinese. To me, this is fun food and personally, I loved the flavor you may not. It's an acquired taste. Pot stickers -  nothing special even if looks different see attached. Hainan chicken - it's good, but not that big of a deal. Just like all the other Hainan chicken.  Crispy egg plant - didn't meet expectation.  Not that special.  More if it coated with battered and mixed salt and pepper into the starch, that should be interestingKimchi fried rice - I liked it!  I liked it so much I didn't wait for the picture. Slightly spicy and didn't get overwhelmed by the kimchi flavor.  Well done.  Beef stew noodle - I'm not crazy about the noodles they used but the soup ain't bad. This place is not bad but the problem is not enough choices on the menu.  It's hard for people to come back and able to try new dishes cause this is tapas restaurant, people came here once might tried most of the dishes.  Suggestion for owner: Put together a monthly special menu. That way people want to come back to try the specials.  It should be a few things and not something slightly change. And rotate your monthly special... Eh, monthly? Or bi-monthly.  Important thing is to get them to come back because there are specials that may or may not serve again.  It also help the kitchen and the chef to manage inventory and efficiency.",
            "In one word: tasty. In two words: small portions. I guess that's why it's called tapas style. Ordered the popular dishes of: Typhoon Ha Gao $6.50Salted Egg Fries $5.75Beef Kimcheese Fried Rice $12.75Half Hainan Chicken $16By far the best thing was Typhoon Ha Gao -- imagine pot sticker shaped HA GAO filling and deep fried with spicy garlic sprinkles -- so damn good but expensive at $6.50 for just 4 pieces. Each piece took two bites to finish.Next best was Salted Egg Fries -- if you're a fan of salted egg batter, you need to order this. It is gooooood! But again, portion was small for $5.75Beef Kimcheese Fried Rice is probably something I could've whipped up at home. Just throw some kimchi and beef with rice, then put scrambled egg on top. They could've added way more cheese. Hainan Chicken is standard dish but again expensive for half $16. I can get a whole steamed chicken from standard bbq place for that price. It was interesting to try this place. They need to get rid of the bug zapper at the entrance. Even though it emits a blue light, that's not the kind of ambience lighting people like.",
            "Had been wanting to try this new place since seeing so many Yelpers checking in here. Note to self -- come back with a larger group to try more menu items! The place was about medium sized space wise with a mix of different size tables. Looks like you might be able to sit outside to eat weather permitting. Not sure how the wafting smells of Guittard Chocolate and In-n-out might affect your dining experience though.Tried the beef noodle soup, Hainan chicken plate, and teppan dumplings. Everything was delicious but thought the Hainan chicken was the best dish. Really flavorful and tender. The rice was also spot on IMHO. And the taste brought back memories of chicken rice found in Southeast Asia. I like my chicken rice with lots of ginger sauce but in the States, restaurants serve it in a little soy sauce size dish. So be sure to ask (don't be shy) for more sauce if that's your thing. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. The owner is actually from the same restaurant group operating Koi Palace, My China and Dragon Beaux. Parking can be a difficult so try the side street.",
            "\"Dirty thoughts\" came to mind when I first saw the name to this place. LolI am so overwhelmed that the last business Cafe Encore finally left, the food was a bit unappetizing and had gone downhill Thank God! Great to see new ownership starting off to a good start.My heart sunk when I heard the owner told  me they were sold out of the \"charcoal bun with pork belly skewers; \" must've been popular. Ordered...Hainan Chicken Noodle SoupXLB Xiao Long BaoHouse Pot StickersStrawberry Milk popping boba (Delicious!)The \"Strawberry Milk Popping Boba was surprisingly delicious made me think I was drinking cross-bred-pink cow freshly milked before it came to my table. The strawberry boba had bursts of flavors. A little kid leaned over my table drooling for a sip. I slowly scooted my drink towards me and gave his mother the eye signal buy him one before he rob me of mine. LolI appreciate them using fresh-strawberries instead of artificial syrup. House pop stickers come plated with four pieces with a nice light brown suntan crispy bottom. The XLB- Xia long Bao dumplings yum!*Note.) The Hainan Chicken Noodle soup does not come with \"egg,\" so if you want one to go along with your dish you need to ask. The options are either fried or a hard boiled egg to go on top for $1.75 extra for one whole egg. The hainan meet is juicy and tender, not big fan of the skin a bit rubbery.I have to come back again! (:",
            "Modern Asian fusion place that opened up where Cafe Encore used to be! It is in the corner of the super busy plaza so it is definitely hard to find parking, especially with In-n-Out here. Waited around 20 minutes for two people, there seemed to be a lot of big parties and families eating. Jasmine Green Tea with Salted Cheese was alright. Near the end of the drink, all I consumed was the salted cheese... probably wouldn't order again though. Beef Noodle Soup was pretty good, in that the beef was tender and juicy. The noodles were just okay for me but the meat made it yummy. Pork Belly Charcoal Bun was good but I feel like they just charge more cause the Bun is charcoal. Pork Belly was seasoned very nicely and wasn't too heavy. Steak Skewer and Bacon wrapped Shrimp with Cheese Skewers we're both really good! I actually really liked how they seasoned their meats. It was a better taste than just the grill taste. Fried Shrimp Dumpling was yummy but a little too salty and doughy. XLB Trio wasn't the best, all the soup spilled out already when we got it. Beef Siu Mai was basically a meat ball so I wouldn't really call it a siu mai....Overall the food was decent but I wouldn't keep coming back. Also since they do skewers and have a grill, you will definitely smell like food when you leave!",
            "Wanted to see what was new on yelp and found this place. We ordered:- hainanese chicken: chicken and sauces was good but the rice looked flavored but was a bit bland- charcoal bun n pork belly: two good size pork belly on skewers w interesting black bun ( made w black sesame food coloring). Pretty tasty- grilled sea bass collar: if you like sea bass this is the dish you should order.  Grilled perfectly w a slight sweet soy n ginger sauce. I would come to stick n steam if I wanted some tasty street food w a twist",
            "The setting was cool and the service was prompt. The food was just ok for me. The plating is hip and the menu has outdoor market/ late night snack food vibes. For the price points, I guess I was expecting a little more. The sea bass collar and pork belly were tasty. The fries and kimcheese fried rice could have been amped up in flavor and seasoning. The quality reminded me of snack foods you get at a boba place like Quickly's. The grilled shrimp was good, but a bit burnt and dry.",
            "As first timers we ordered a lot of food because I wanted to try it all. We had lots of leftovers and their yakitori portions were very generous (I was thinking they were like Mokutanya down the street)salted egg yolk fries: you have to like salted egg to begin with. If you do you'll definitely enjoy these friesteppan dumplings: sizzling pork dumplings served on a sizzling plate, very tasty XLB trio: 3 pieces, regular - crab- truffle. It was good but not DTF good. Also wish their sauce was more vinegary typhoon ha gao: fried shrimp dumpling, not soggy, perfectly fried pork belly with charcoal buns: each order comes with 2 buns with 2 skewers of pork belly and their salad to put inside the buns. Very generous portion of pork belly on their skewersbeef noodle soup: my husband is a fan of DTF beef noodle soup, this one doesn't have that kick of spice but he actually really enjoyed it and came in 2nd place for him. He even wanted to go back for this soup the very next day hahakimchee fried rice: good but I don't think you can mess up kimchee fried rice too muchpotsticker: tasty and the perfect crispsea bass collar: a must and my favorite dish, even my 3 year old loved ithainan chicken plate: I have to admit- I never order this dish mainly because of its appearance. It doesn't even looked cooked. But I ordered it because the reviews were good. And surprisingly the chicken was very tasty and soft!Skewers:NY prime steak Sweet cornBacon wrapped shrimp-All tasty and portions exceeded my expectations.Strawberry milk with strawberry popping boba: My son loved it. I liked how real strawberries were also usedRose lychee sparkling water: The most refreshing combo and a must!Passion fruit aloe green tea: Also refreshingAlso, we celebrated my Mom's bday here. My brother brought in some cream puffs from Beard Papa and they were nice enough to arrange them on a platter for us. They even added a few pieces of what looked like a sponge cake to the corners of the plate :)Definitely recommend this restaurant.

            "Nothing warms [AND CLOGS] my heart better than unique, new dim sum places in the Peninsula! When I heard that SxS opened just a few weeks ago and was running an automatic 10% promo through the end of the month, my thrifty, heifer self bolted over there seemingly faster than a speeding bullet.My decision to run over to this place was quickly affirmed by the large menu of classic and creative items on the menu and relatively inexpensive prices! Some of my favorites were the pork belly baos, which boasted a ridiculously generous pork:bun ratio, and the trio of XLB: classic, truffle, and crab. The neon sign and plasma TV lend itself to the more modern, American-influenced type of dim sum restaurant, as do the small twists on each dish. If you're not a Chinese food purist and are open to trying your favorite dim sum dishes with a bit of a fusion spin, I'd say this place will be a hit for you!"

            "This place is a hidden gem if you don't know about it. I was planning a birthday lunch for myself and needed a place to take a large group of people. A friend told me that he had been here before for another party and it was good experience. The start, the drive way is from hell. If you drive anything remotely lowered, you will scrape if you don't go at an angle or my car is just stupid low. I had to park in front of the restaurant on the street which was fine.When we finally got in when they opened up, they seated our large party fair quickly. I believe there was 15 or 17 of us and they had a table already setup. I would recommend that you set a reservation ahead of time so they know how many people are coming. When you set the reservation for a large party, they keep very good contact with you for the upcoming event. They had sent over a menu and listed what would be prepared ahead of time when your party gets there so that you're not waiting for food for too long. I believe we had about 8-10 dishes prepared ahead of time so we only had to wait about 5 minutes before food started to come out.After the starter dishes get sent out, you can finally open up that menu and start marking what you want. We got there when they first opened so our service was fast. We ordered large amounts of sashimi which came out fresh and on these large boats that fill the table. That was a cool sight to see.All the food was good and decent quality for sushi. They accommodated our large party with good service. I would host a party here again no problem.",
            "[ Long story short - one of the rolls had rotten fish]. Very disappointing. I've been coming here 2-3 times a year and always had a good experience. The lunch menu was (in 2017-2018) $31 all you can eat sushi (on the weekend) and the menu is varied (hot dishes, cold plates, sushi). Came in today with friends for the first time in a few months. I wish I didn't. It started with the smell. I don't know if it's the old carpet or the rain outside making everything inside smell that way but it was very off putting. Next to our window seat, there was yellow rotten foam insulation. Is it toxic? It really should be cleaned up. In our first order, the fish was good (fresh and tasty) but the rice was undercooked. The second order then came. Halfway through, I realize the scallop in the spicy scallop roll is yellow (not white). We take turns to smell the fish. It was bad. Actually fish-gone bad-do NOT serve to customers- bad. We stopped eating. I told our waitress about the fish and showed it to her and she said it was normal, bla-bla-bla this is how it is prepared and maybe we just don't like it prepped that way. Please show me a customer that enjoys eating raw fish that has gone bad and I will take this review down. Do NOT try to make me believe that it's the preparation of the fish that is the issue. I had to insist to have a discount (which is really a gesture of good faith from the restaurant side) and they begrudgingly priced the roll at $5 and removed it from the bill. Side note on the itemized menu, it it $7. And to top it off, they increased their lunch price  from $31 to $41. Absurd. I hope none of us gets sick tonight.",
            "Found this place on yelp and looked through the pictures and saw beautiful massive plates of nigiri... was deceived because there is a maximum number you can order per person... so for 2 people-- our plates and orders per round did not look like those pictures... and also you can't order the next round until after all your things come out and you finish itHonestly this matters a lot because personally I like to have a good amount of food infront of me when I'm paying for AYCE. By limiting the amount you can order, it makes the process of eating not as efficient because you literally eat for like 5 minutes and then have to order more and having to wait 10-15min for it to come out.Sitting around for so long made me really full after like the second round.. this is why I believe that Monster Chef is not a great AYCE spot to get bang for your buck. Might as well get sushi ordered by plate at a nice restaurant.But on the bright side-- I did really enjoy their salmon belly nigiri!",
            "$41 feels pricey for AYCE sushi but considering that there aren't many other places in the Bay Area where you can eat it at, Monster Chef is worth trying at least once. (Although pairing it with AYCD for $50 seems like a steal). The fish quality is pretty high for AYCE, I appreciated the variety of food available (everything from appetizers to sashimi to rolls to bowls) and that you can order half rolls but I think with any AYCE sushi place, it starts to get overwhelming after a while. The only thing I'd note is that our tea tasted fishy, but other than that, had a good experience with the place.",
            "AYCE sushi, yes please! I first heard about Monster Chef from my parents (surprisingly - I'm usually the one recommending places to eat). We came here on a Sunday for dinner, after visiting the half moon bay pumpkin patches. The wait was around 10 minutes. The cost per person was over $40. When we were finally seated, we ordered some fresh oysters to start (not included in the AYCE menu). Then toughed it out for 3 rounds of food! The menu consists of from the grill/fried food and raw/sushi, sashimi, and nigiri. A little different from other AYCE Japanese restaurants I've been too...which is mostly just sushi. We came with a party of 6, and each person was allowed 3 items each per round. So in total...18 orders would come out per round. Quite a lot.We tried pretty much everything and it was all so yummy and filling. Keep in mind there isn't much selection of specialty rolls. But they have dons, shu mai, fries, fried soft shell crab, and other things. At the end of the meal, you can get self-serve ice cream...so dangerous. I got the green tea, and a big scoop of it!",
            "Hands down best sushi restaurant we been too. Service was awesome, everyone was so friendly. The quality of the sashimi was very high. The price was well worth every penny. I live an hour away, but will definitely come back!",
            "Very very yummy. There's some rules to all you can eat, but that is expected. Try the Monster Dynamite roll! The hot green tea was also fresh and delicious. We were confused by the tip situation though. The bottom of the menu said \"we are proud to be tip free\" but the receipt had percentages on it....",
            "Update: After speaking with the management, they invited us back. This experience we had was completely different than before. Everyone was polite, cleanliness was maintained, and overall much improvement. We had a new bus boy this time and every time he came by, he said \"excuse me, I have your order of ____\" or \"excuse me, can I take this away\". God it was so refreshing after my previous experience. Monster chef has taken the necessary precautions after I told them my incident. I'm glad to hear something was done. Will come back someday because those Hokkaido scallops are to die for. Old review: BEWARE! If you plan on eating here even after looking at my review. Please please don't ever pay attention to the servers giving you your food. From my experience tonight here are two key moments and helped me make that conclusion:1. The server put a plate that we didn't order on our table n left quickly so we didn't get a chance to stop him (normally they check the receipt but this time he didn't). Minutes later, he comes back, takes the plate, and gave it to another table. Seriously?! That is so disgusting. 2. Same server comes up to our table with food we ordered. He tilted the tray that was carrying multiple items so a tofu fell off the plate onto the tray. He proceeds to pick it up WITH HIS BARE HANDS, puts it back onto the plate, and gave it to us. I am so shocked with his actions. Because I witnessed all that, I really did lose my appetite. I notified one of the waiters of the situation going on and even he was disgusted with what he heard. Yeah, this place has a nice variety of sashimi and cooked foooptions including Hokkaido scallops with I love, but no way that is good enough to lure me back...",
            "Wow. This place was FREAKIN DELICIOUS. Can't speak for poopie service like everyone else was complaining about. Like seriously. Get. The. Sashimi. It's just....WOW. I had never had truffle oil salmon before. I didn't know I liked it. And now? Now I do. You know why? I ate at Monster Chef, that's why! And you know what? You should eat at Monster Chef and get the truffle oil salmon too!In my humble opinion, the extra $4 or $8 or whatever it is for the fatty tuna/uni is ONLY worth it if you are the biggest fatty tuna or uni fan in the world. They're both pretty delicious.I came in on a random, cold, dreary Saturday in December after making a reservation online like a week in advance. Guess what - the restaurant was not too busy, and the reservation was unnecessary! Google has a feature where you can actually look at just how busy the place you're visiting usually is at any given time. If it's a holiday or other festive occasion, then you can bet your socks that it'll be even busier! I was fortunate enough to choose a day/time where it wouldn't be too busy and...there was great service! Wow!One thing that was a bit suspect...there's still suggested gratuity on the receipt despite the menu touting that gratuity costs are included in the overall price of the meal. Pretty strange, but I like to err on the side of my wallet so I didn't leave any extra tip, because I \\\\think// that I already tipped? I wish the store was a little more clear in that regard! As for the food? Well, if you couldn't tell..it's great! Especially the sashimi! Don't order anything else...because then you get to tell the story of how you ordered the **insert random non-fish dish here** and then complained about it after going to a restaurant that's known for...FISH!!!!!!",
            "Pretty decent in terms of sushi by the water. Monster Chef allows you to choose between either doing a meal or an all-you-can-eat option. My friends and I came through on a Sunday night around 6pm and we were able to get seated within 10 minutes. They limit your time to 2 hours and you can grab your own edamame or ice cream. So... AYCE is usually a hit or miss depending on the service. Service for us started pretty good with the waiter explaining how the process worked for us. Each member can choose up to 3 plates at once so a party of 6 was able to order 18 plates. It sounds like a lot, but a lot of them were small plates with just enough portions for 6 evenly. I think like most people, the first round came out fairly quickly which got us super excited. Most foods were pretty decent and their sushi rolls had great flavor. Sashimi and nigiri had good slices of fish. The downside came when the second and third round of food came out slower than the first. Most of us haven't ate anything all day so this was a bit hard to endure. Food wise - some things were a hit and worth reordering (go for the Monster fries) and some were a miss (shishito fries are not real fries). Soda and tea are included in the AYCE price which is great and their tea has legit green tea flavor to it - super strong you can smell it. Overall, I say this place is AT LEAST a solid 3. Could've been better had the food come out quicker, but that's the thing with AYCE places, I guess. They also have their own parking lot, but cars that have been lowered are going to find it a struggle to get up so stick to the streets.",
            "Came with high hopes for the all you can eat (ayce) because sashimi comes with it. Good as expected but only for nigiri and sashimi. I don't recommend that you come here for anything else except the raw fish itself. Monster/special Rolls were meh. Hand rolls were eh. Miso ramen was terrible. It was more like jasmine tea with crunchy noodles. Tempura batter was plain. But Sashimi and nigiri was wonderful. Fresh, cold, and just plain yummy. Best sashimi and nigiri that i've had in awhile. Rice was seasoned well. Happy that edamame and ice cream were free appetizers.I would drive an hour here just for the fresh fish. I love the salmon/tuna/hamachi here. Service was fine.",
            "I found out about this place about 3 weeks ago and have already been there twice! It is very hard to find a good AYCE sushi place in the Bay Area but this is probably the best AYCE place that I have found so far. First off, they are only open Friday-Sunday, therefore, you could only imagine that there are always people trying to make it on these days and the wait can get pretty long depending on what time you come. The first time we came around 7 with no reservations and waited about 30-40 minutes, which isn't too bad considering I waited more for another sushi place. The second time, we came around 6 with a reservation at 6:15 and got seated immediately. The service here is dependent on how busy it is tbh. The first time we came, we weren't too happy with the service since it was slow to get our drinks, and even our food and it also takes a while for us to get a hold of a server to put in our next order. Our second time, they weren't too busy since we came relatively early and the server were so attentive to us, asking us if we need to put in another order and coming back to refill our drinks every time it goes to 1/4 of the glass. So my recommendation is to have a reservation for the place and go early.A side note about the reservation, you have to book it 24 hours before your reserved time and any cancellation or changes have to also be made 24 hours before your reserved time. They respond to emails very quickly and you also have to put in a pre-order if you make reservations. This is to ensure both they have enough food to serve everyone and to also make the process a lot faster when you get there. I had a last minute change to the number of people going with me and emailed them a day in advance and they quickly respond back and confirm that the reservation was updated. Our first order also came pretty quick as it wasn't as busy and we also pre-ordered our dishes. You have to order 6 orders per person in the pre-order, which is more than they let you order in the restaurant (3 order per person). My party and I went for the sashimi and nigiri because that is the best part of eating sushi in my opinion and it does not disappoint! My favorite sashimi is salmon, so I got both the salmon sashimi and the truffle salmon nigiri and both are amazing. The salmon almost melts in your mouth. I'm not the biggest fat of tuna, but after having their tuna, I am amazed. Their tuna quality was really good and it also melts in my mouth. After chatting with the server, I found out that the tuna is craved right there in the restaurant and they leave the head on ice for display at the front of the restaurant. The yellow tail and scallops were also amazing and the squid as well.Overall, this place is my favorite AYCE sushi place within the Bay Area. The quality was amazing and the portion was great for each order too. Paying ~50-60 per person after tax, tip and drinks, is totally worth it considering I pay more for other sushi place within the Bay Area that are A la Carte. TLDR: Go for the Sashimi and Truffle Salmon NigiriFish quality: 4.5 out of 5Service: 4 out of 5 (it is a hit or a miss)",
            "Monster Chef is the best all you can eat sushi spot I've tried so far. Unlike other restaurants, they serve high quality sushi along with a wide variety of options. They also have an all you can drink sake and sushi option!My boyfriend's sister made a reservation for our group of 12 and she was provided with a preset menu to approve so that the food could be ready to come out as soon as we arrived. There was a 2 hour time limit for our lunch, which started when a majority of our party was seated. Our favorites were the sashimi boat and salmon nigiri w truffle oil. The service was pretty quick in the beginning, but slowed down considerably toward the end of the meal. Overall, the staff was friendly and even helped clean up a little mess made by a toddler in our group. We'll be back soon!",
            "Host is useless. A bunch of people waiting to be sit down for 20 minutes and the restaurant had 5 empty tables!",
            "When I hear \"AYCE sushi\" I'm usually very skeptical, but Monster Chef delivered! Came here early-ish (5:30pm) on a Saturday and avoided a wait. TL;DR: Everything was so good and I can't wait to go back.It's $41/person for dinner, and if you stick to the higher-end stuff (sashimi and other seafood), it's definitely worth it. I saw a family eating just rice and noodles and I was like \"wut???\" but to each their own.To get the most bang for our buck, my husband and I hit the nigiri and sashimi part of the menu hard, getting multiple orders of salmon and scallops, which were both such good quality for an AYCE joint. The albacore was also great! We liked the salmon roe and unagi nigiri but didn't want to fill up on rice. The clam in broth, fried baby octopus and soft shell crab were delicious too. I imagine it'd be better to come in a group if you want to order rolls or bigger apps, but we had a set goal of filling up on sashimi. I thought the pace was good. We didn't have to wait too long between orders and the food came out relatively quickly. I'd recommend coming with a game plan so that you don't just fill up on random fried foods. If you love sashimi like I do, this place is your jam!",
            "If you're CRAVING SUSHI/SASHIMI, and you're in the Northern California....I would highly HIGHLY recommend coming here! They serve ALL YOU CAN EAT (AYCE) SASHIMI! Yes, you heard me correctly, sashimi!! Please be warned that there is a 2 hour limit and SERVICE IS SLOW....so look at the menu prior to coming so that once you sit down, you can order right away. There will be 20-25 minutes periods where you won't have any food on the table.Lunch AYCE - $36Dinner AYCE - $41  Child AYCE - $16/$19ALL YOU CAN DRINK (AYCD) - $9Lunch and dinner have the same menu!!** if you just get the ACYE, it still comes with unlimited soda and iced green tea****ALL PRICES ALREADY INCLUDE TAX AND TIP!**If you plan on coming with a big party and make a reservation on Yelp, they will most likely email you afterwards asking you to PRE-ORDER items first so that they would have everything prepared when we arrive. (6 items per person for pre-order).-- To be honest, I thought this would make everything go faster, but I still had to wait around 15-20 minutes before my food arrived. :(side comment, but I noticed that...MORE SASHIMI = THINNER SLICES of sashimi (or at least from my experience)At the very end, they give you a complimentary ice cream scoop. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying their COFFEE ICE CREAM! It's definitely not your typical coffee ice cream :) UPDATE!I've been here a couple times, and since my last visit, May 2018, they have added/removed some items on their menu. - They do NOT have MONK FISH LIVER anymore :(",
            "For some reason we had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated when there were many tables inside that were open. Never mind that, once we got inside we had high hopes for the $41 all-you-can-eat since $41 is definitely not the cheapest. However, we were definitely let down as it took upwards of 45 minutes for each round of food to be brought out (each person is allowed to order 3 dishes per round). On top of that, at 7:45pm-the time we left at-they had already begun running out of food, leaving us to wonder what exactly the people after us would have at 10pm. We left after the 2hr limit hungry having not even gotten our entire third round of food since we couldn't stand waiting another 45 min for our food. Definitely wouldn't recommend, and we're honestly not sure how they haven't gone under yet.The one bright stop was that at least our waiter was extremely respectful and understanding (shout-out to you in the white bandana).",
            "Arrived to this place when they opened on a weekend night after reading all the reviews.Waited for about 15 minutes and then were seated. The sanitation of the place can really be worked on, but the all you can eat sashimi and countless hot foods are good.This place reminds me of Hong Kong all you can eat places where you can order small amounts and taste fresh fish and food all throughout. You also get free soft drinksA nice place for all you can eat. Hope they really work on the overall decor though!",
            "Man I came here with really high hopes, and I was let down. I had to give them my credit card info to make a reservation here so I thought it had to be good.I was really hoping to find a place where I would get fresh ayce sashimi. However, the sashimi I had here was far from fresh, and clearly frozen. It had a hint of freezer burn to it. Strangely, the food here was not entirely horrible as their fried foods were really good. I highly recommend their fried oysters. They were plump and very well breaded. Great with beer! Service was kind of slow, but the servers were very friendly. The decor of this place is BEAUTIFUL, and I love that it's seaside.Maybe I was here on an off day, but this is the impression I have of it. I don't think I'll try it again, because I'm not from close by.",
            "All you can eat lunch: $36All you can eat dinner: $41Includes tax and tips and some sodas. That's right, no need to add any tips unless service is spectacular which in my case is not really. Food comes out really slow. I know it's the chefs fault but probably also a tactic so you will feel full faster. Every time a dish or two comes out, we (just my hubby and I) ate slowly (we weren't that hungry) while chit chatting and when we finished the plates, we had to watch the TV or play on our phone to keep ourselves entertained while waiting for the next dish to come out. I will say around 5-10 mins waiting everytime we finish 2-3 dishes.What's disappointing is the salmon sashimi. They were super teeny tiny slices. I've never seen such thin slices of sashimi before! So stingy man. I didnt remember it being this thin and tiny when we came last year!What's most disappointing is the ice cream. We can only have one ice cream per person. Ridiculous. Their ice cream size is a tiny dollop!"

            "Eleven is a great addition to Bolinas!  I love their pizzas, and the buffalo ice cream is delicious.  The restaurant has a nice wine list and very friendly ambiance.  I ate there late last night and had a great meal.",
            "Came here after an afternoon at Stinson Beach. We were planning on just stopping by to drink some wine and maybe buy a bottle to take to dinner with us later (we had reservations at another restaurant). Ended up cancelling that reservation and staying at Eleven since the wine list was *fire*, the atmosphere was cozy and the other couple sitting at the bar had a pizza that looked very tasty.Saw a big bowl of olives on the bar and asked for an order. The bartender told us to help ourselves. OMG free olives??? OMG and they're actually delicious too???We ordered:Kumamoto & sweet water oystersBurrata with early girl tomatoes, basil, focaccia, balsamic/olive oil Special: Whole roasted branzino with french fries Pizza: spicy sausageBuffalo milk soft serve. Ordered two as affogatos. I devoured mine and started eating my husbands order.. then my friends... and seriously seriously thought about ordering myself another one.It's not a huge menu and the dishes are simple but everything came out well executed and the ingredients were fresh.Will definitely be back when I'm in the area. Side note: This place only serves natural wine. Good for me because I only drink natural wine. Read a negative review about this place and they were complaining about the wine. Didn't like natural wine when I first tried it but now it's the only kind of wine I drink. IGNORE the negative review, TRY some natty wine and keep an open mind about it.",
            "Delicious pizza with local ingredients. Great wine list, nicely paired with pizza and local oysters. Cozy, friendly atmosphere.",
            "Amazing dinner here on a Saturday. Loved the oysters, gem salad, and mushroom pizza. The wine was amazing too. Can't wait to go back!",
            "Second time here and will not be the last. Overall good food, friendly & responsive service and fabulous West Marin rustic atmosphere. PROS:-Great pizza. Four of us shared a margherita pizza and an anchovy garlic pizza. Both were great although I thought the margherita was the best. Really nice chewy crust around the edge and thin/crisp bottom. -Escarole Caesar salad was very good. Loved the panko topping although next time I'd probably ask them to go a lighter on the dressing. It was quite tasty but just a bit heavy for my taste. -Very good service. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and responsive without being intrusive. -The atmosphere is great. It's West Marin \"hip rustic\" yet very comfortable and clean. Not sure how it would be on a crowded Sat. night but we felt very cozy sitting and chatting after our meal and never felt rushed or pushed. -Although some reviewers mentioned the limited menu, that was a plus for me. It is limited but we don't come here for a huge selection. We come because what they do they do well, and the smaller menu allows them to take advantage of the great local, organic ingredients West Marin has to offer. CONS:-The main con for me was the wine list. It could use a few more choices, one or two additional reds and a few lower priced glasses/bottles. Next time I would probably opt for bringing my own and paying corkage. Overall 11 Wharf is a much needed addition to the very limited Bolinas/Stinson food scene.",
            "Really excellent staff, much more then just a \"money for food\" transaction...  I like the wine list, and found a really great Pinot I had never heard of.  I appreciate that they manage to have a lively atmosphere without it being so loud as to distract from the meal.   I really enjoyed eating there and will be back!",
            "Meh. Not impressed. The food was decent but somewhat overpriced and a very limited menu. The staff was totally uninspired, lacking enthusiasm and not particularly friendly. They did the bare minimum. No nice greeting, no friendly manners...just took our order and brought the check. Lucky for these guys they're the only game in town or I suspect they would adjust their methods.",
            "My hubs about summed it up. It was really good. I wanted the eggplant pizza and he wanted the pepperoni. So we got both. The eggplant with shihito peppers was the stand out. It was both our favorites. We really enjoyed the super crisp crusts. The menu is small, and some of it changes each week. I look forward to seeing what's new next time.",
            "I wanted to love this restaurant.  I've lived  in Bolinas for 30 years.The pizza was fine, but the pizza at the community center is better, I had a great little salad all in all the meal was fine with the exception of the wine list . I'm not a wine snob but the two ones I tasted were undrinkable ,The wine list honestly is by far the worst wine list of any restaurant or pub I've been to, The waitress was very sweet offering me different tastes after two (I was embarrassed  to ask for another taste , I just ordered a lovely ginger soda, I would have ordered a bottle of wine for our table but there was nothing on the list that look remotely worth popping a bottle open for ,FYI when I tasted the Shiraz it was effervescent. Get some Good California wines in here  there are so many to choose from. And why would you not offer our own world famous Bolinas wine marker  Sean Thackeray ,about a mile away ? The wait staff was very friendly , our experience was going just fine ,but I had  a extremely simple question about the bill and Kate I believe her name was the owner or manager was the go to person .This was just about the rudest woman I have ever spoken to in a very long time (and I'm in the construction business ) we had a lovely time The meal was adequate (but gigantic room for improvement on the wine list) she ruined the entire experience for us ,this woman has chosen the wrong career ,she should be a Government worker where she can treat people poorly and still get promoted . I have never experienced such a nasty person I will never go back, because of my interaction with her, I will never refer this restaurant. If you read my other reviews you can see I rarely say anything negative. I can see other people have commented on her on other review platforms.",
            "I'll start with the positives. The room was very nice and comfortable and the location is pretty much in the center of town. The pizza at the restaurant was also good!As for the not-so-goods, well the rooms are right above the kitchen. So, even though the restaurant closes at 9pm, the kitchen workers played their music very loud as they cleaned up (I'm assuming that's what they were doing.) The music kept us up until midnight. Second, Google indicates that a free breakfast is included. That is not the case as we were informed when we inquired as to when breakfast was served. Finally (and the kicker), we had dinner at the restaurant which, as I said, was pretty good. The service was just okay though, so we left a 10% tip. Yeah, not our usual 20% but still a socially acceptable tip. The owner (I think) confronted us outside the restaurant asking why we left such a small tip. Very awkward, but we told her why. She then accused us of leaving the small tip because we were upset about the no breakfast thing. It was very weird and made the rest of our stay uncomfortable.I would say that, if you are going to Bolinas, find another place to stay.",
            "This place is amazing. Met the owners- they pour their heart and soul into this place. The ambiance, the food, the wine selection... is all perfect.",
            "First time trying this place and definitely will try again.  An unexpected and pleasant surprise was the small appetizer of two green olives that was brought to our table with our waters.  Excellent wine selection, and limited menu offerings, but they were well thought out.  Oysters, salad, pizzas and desert were offered.  We ended up ordering two pizzas.  Pizza #1 was the Margherita with pepperoni added.  It was a good pepperoni pizza, but I would not have considered it a Margherita pizza since there were only a few scattered puny pieces of basil on the pizza that almost appeared to be an afterthought.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I was expecting the Margherita to be the focus and not the pepperoni.  The star of the night was the eggplant pizza with shishito peppers with a harissa drizzle.  This was a piece of art I did not expect.  The mingling of the flavors was tantalizing and was our hands done favorite.  The crust was crispy and expertly cooked.  This place is definitely worth trying.",
            "Excellent. The food was great, the service was great. The only negative is that it's designed for tiny people. The tables are very small and the chairs are micro. The decor is hipster black, grey and white, devoid of color. Overall it makes up for the short comings with great service and excellent food.",
            "Found this place on Yelp... fell in love with it as soon as we walked in. Super tiny inside, got a table right at the bar. It's inside an old Victorian style house, so it's not \"open\", but that can make it more romantic. Very clean and modern inside. Waitress was good, let me sample a wine to see if I'd like it before buying. We ordered the Margherita pizza with pepperoni, super tasty! Nice wine list, not very big, but just right. I would definitely go back, very pleased with the whole experience. Affordable, good music, great atmosphere. Dino was very pleasant, too.",
            "This is a nice little B&B. If breakfast had been available, it would have been fantastic. However, the place is under construction and will soon have a wine bar below. We had a nice time in the claw foot tub for one person and then in the bed that works for both of us even though I'm kinda large. The room was clean and neat and bright and warm in the winter. Worth every penny.Run by Kate and Rebecca, at this point you're not likely to see them. They currently have a system of checking in on your own and accessing your room, which they'll email you about. Save the info for this.This B&B is in the quaint little town of Bolinas which is hell to find, but great once you get there. If you surf, love the ocean, or enjoy little (and I mean little) towns, you'll love Bolinas. It's a creative, peaceful community with good folks. Across the street you'll find a rockin' community center that has an active weekend entertainment calendar. Bolinas is mostly about the ocean though -- surfing, hiking, anything outdoors. Take note of the free wifi in the room so you can find all the nearby hiking trails, beaches, and tide pools.This address is an historic 1890's farmhouse is nestled within the downtown village. It has previously served as the home of the Wild Rose Restaurant and the Blue Heron Inn. It will soon be Eleven Wine Bar & Bistro (Spring 2016). The B&B rooms are upstairs in the back. One enters from the side and there are small cafe tables outside for semi-private breakfast dining. There's one good restaurant, a cafe, a breakfast kiosk and a bar in town. The restaurant, Coast Cafe, is very good. There's not too much else in town. If you are a writer, or an artist, or have a liberal, progressive bent, you'll feel right at home (maybe more at home than you've ever felt). The view from the room is of a gas station, but you're a mile walk from the ocean and you'll want to stop at all the charming places in the town on your way for snacks -- like the organic People's Food Grocery (or something like that). Get a drink and relax at the local bar if you want, but see the sunset from here. The beach is on a lovely angle western angle, so there's a real photo opportunity for you and your's at the beach.  There's a duplicate listing under the name 11 Wharf Rd. Try the place out! You'll find it every bit as romantic as we did on our Valentine's Day weekend. P.S. Take a left IMMEDIATELY after the lagoon, which is just 10 miles beyond the town of Stinson, up north on HWY 1 from SF. The road is COMPLETELY unmarked - no road sign, no direction arrow and nothing on the way to tell you how far or when you've missed it. So -- right after the lagoon ends. Right then. Turn left and make your way into the town. Can't miss the place then. I'll give this cute place five stars in spite of it's current B&B without a breakfast status..........................................................................email for the place: beccabolinas@gmail.combut you book online at this site: 11wharfroad.com/book",
            "We had quite an experience. I recommend you watch the tides! Emily and I got hit hard by high tide and the owners were so welcoming  and fun. Especially when they realized we lost all our belongings to the sea. (Watch the tides!)  They let us hand out in towels until.....Steve was able to get into our car and finally we could shower and be clothed. They brought us excellent bubbly rose followed by a Malbec (I think). The wine and company was fantastic!  They played some Miles Davis to relax us.They went out of their way to make sure we were okay. Great memories sitting on the steps, getting to know them and meeting locals.Now, the bath tub was awesome with high quality bath salts, shampoos etc. And fabulous organic essential oil products from the gal next door (sorry I can't remember her name.. we had a lot going on).Dan from Smileys stopped by, such a nice guy!Even in our unfortunate situation we had a fabulous time and a great night sleep.. awesome bedding!You will be lucky to stay here. But plan accordingly and their dining is only Thursday - Sunday.  The Coast Cafe has limited hours so stock up at the health food store across the street if necessary . Awesome place too!We will be back and beach to the right of the wall.... Ha!",
            "Such a bummer because this place truly does have so much potential! I was so excited to stop by this little town and relax in this adorable bed & breakfast only to find it wasn't so adorable and it isn't a bed and breakfast, it's just a bed. First off when I arrived I read the confirmation incorrectly and went into the wrong room. As soon as I entered I saw it was dirty and was going to call when I went to the email I saw it was actually room 1 we were supposed to be in so I quickly ran out and went to the correct room. Apparently the code they give you works for either room which is concerning, and does this code change for every new reservation? I mean this was a huge red flag, especially considering I'm a single mother and it seemed like a safety issue. Second, the smell is horrendous. It was making me nauseated and my poor 8 year old was begging to leave because she couldn't tolerate the smell. It smells like a cat, or several cats, have  been using this room as a kitty litter box. Right away I opened all the windows and went to the people store across the street and purchased two $12 candles and $5 fragrance spray. I went back to the room, sprayed it, lit both candles and we walked down to the water and went over to Stinson Beach for dinner. We came back two hours later and it still smelt awful so I'm thinking it's just its permanent odor. Aside from the odor there were other minor negative things, like there is no rug in the bathroom as pictured. The patio definitely does not look as pictured. There are no pillows on the chairs, or nice set up. There is a couple dingy tables covered in cobwebs.Also - don't expect any wine or even a bottle of water for that matter. After doing further research I found this was actually the Blue Heron B&B and their reviews were awful which made sense now. It seems like maybe they changed the name or it may even be new ownership but it doesn't seem as though they did much to actually improve it. Oh, and the Blue Heron only charged $100 a night and Eleven charged $215 for the night which I feel was a complete rip off for just a bed in a stinky room but oh well, the sweet little town was worth it I suppose!",
            "This is a wonderful gem in bolinas!   Amazing food, great atmosphere.  It's just a treasure.",
            "Everything about the place is special: the food, the wine, the vibe.  The pizzas and salads are fantastic and sourced with ingredients sourced from local organic farms.  The Hog Island oysters are crazy fresh and served either straight up or with some magic mixture of condiments that enhances the flavor.  The wines I've tried so far were all superb and really compliment the food.  Even the music is beyond.  But the truly unique aspect of Eleven is embodied by the people who run it.  They're fun, friendly, knowledgable and most importantly, they've got soul.  And they've brought it to Bolinas."

            "Came here last night: it was cool. 35 dollars an hour per lane. Astro Fridays though are their 'disco light' days?",
            "We've been coming to Sea Bowl for several years. It's reliably clean, you can almost always go bowling without having to wait for an open lane and there's plenty of parking in their private lot.But the lane charges? It's becoming the reason to go spend money elsewhere.And today they greedily raised the hourly rate from $40 to $45 because of the MLK holiday.Add in shoe rentals, buying time so five kids can hurriedly bowl a couple of games, food, soda and the arcade, you're looking at $175. Ouch.And they must get rid of the tip feature on the credit card reader. There's no option to decline (I chafed then meekly hit 15% the first time I encountered it). Hit zero to clear it. I tip well. I tip 20-25% at the grill but to tip when you're renting the lane and shoes? That's a \"no\".All that said, there are many great things about Sea Bowl: family fun; decent bar with terrific fire-grilled cheeseburgers, pizzas and bomb onion rings; an arcade to bid farewell to a roll or two of quarters; well-maintained and clean.Plus, the staff is always pleasant, especially VJ who deftly moves among the lanes cleaning up spilled soda, helping people set the score-keeping board or retrieve a wayward bowling ball. He has a sunny personality and takes such pride in his work. Sea Bowl, I like you lots but you'd make more money from customers like me who'd come more often if the prices were lower and you had a loyalty program.",
            "I've been coming to Sea Bowl since I was a small fry.  My parents bowled league here for numerous years while I used to hang out at the arcade.  This was all before the remodel and what a difference it made.  This spot pretty much has everything you need in a bowling alley.  You've got tons of lanes, a huge eating area, a decent arcade, and a pro shop.  I went early on a weekday and the price was $3/game.  Not bad in comparison to other bowling alleys in the Bay Area although I miss those 99 cent games.  That's long gone.The lanes look like they're well kept although they were extremely dry when we went.  The bathrooms bugged me though.  How can you not have paper towels in a bathroom in a bowling alley?  Bowling with semi wet hands is dangerous and not ideal.  Otherwise, you just need to sit there and wait til your hands dry.  Anyhoo, parking is plentiful and I like the updates.",
            "Sea bowl, sea...bowl?Sunday afternoon family bowling. No silly, not my real family. Our friend group that we have made into our family. I'm mom because I drive everyone around and curtail the noise. We all love Pacifica so what' better than bowling in Pacifica and hitting the beach (aka some rocks that overlook the water) on a Sunday night?Anyway, we got here and decided to do the family package (huh, what a coincidence) because it was a good dealFamily package ($70) vs. regular $40 for an hour + shoe cost:- 2 hours of bowling + shoes- pizza-pitcher of sodaThe guy who made our pizza had a personal vendetta against our half olive, half mushroom pizza. Now that I think about it, we had a vendetta and substantial regret about it too LOL. The pizza is your typical bowling alley bready, greasy pizza.Sea bowl is on Sea bowl way, or something like that. Anyway, it's fun!",
            "I came here with my boyfriend this past Friday and it was cosmic bowling. We were able to get a Lane after waiting an hour, which wasn't so bad we just chilled at the full bar and talked until it was our turn. The Lane was $40 for two hours plus shoe rentals. We had a blast. We both had not bowled in awhile. This place is a deal compared to any of the sports in SF that charge $70 plus for a lane and make it not such a date night activity. At $40 you can still keep it just the two of you. Highly recommend.",
            "Completely discriminates against people with children. Super crowded, but thought that would be ok because there is a nice seating area visible from the registration line. Tried to go in and were immediately turned away. They call it the \"bar\" and don't allow kids. It's the same room as the crappy tables where they do allow people with kids. Totally discriminatory.",
            "Last Saturday, I had my daughter's six year old birthday party at Sea Bowl. So this is a review for the kid birthday parties. They get five stars for creating an awesome little kid birthday party experience! We had a lot of compliments from parents who said it was such a fun birthday, and that made me a very satisfied mom! Sea Bowl markets their kid birthday parties as \"specifically designed for today's busy moms, our complete turnkey packages include bowling, food, party host, balloons, party supplies and fun\". They had me at turnkey. Really - I give them five stars because the party truly was turnkey and I had just ordered the basic birthday package. The two hour birthday party came with everything they listed and even small, really cute touches, like, they took a picture of my daughter and I. Then they displayed it on the screens in our lanes with Happy Birthday on it. Everyone thought it was so cute, and it was!Our party host was so friendly and helpful. She explained how everything would go and she was our personal go-to person for getting shoes when people arrived. When the plastic cake cutter we brought ourselves broke, our party host saved the day by bringing us a nice heavy duty stainless steel one. When I forgot the lighter for the candles, our party host saved the day by getting us matches. Yay party host! You get two hours of birthday party time with one hour of bowling and one hour in the party room. Sea Bowl was super busy with birthday parties that day and the party room was split in two. It was a little distracting for the young kids to have another party going on right next to ours (they put up rolling separators) but it was manageable. The other downside was that our party host forgot to get our goodie bags together for our guests even though we had requested them. Luckily though, we weren't charged for them. So, no harm, no foul. The room decorations were so cute and playful and complete. My daughter went ga-ga for the whole bunch of balloons they had in the room. The pizzas were a hit for everyone, I think 99% of the slices were gone. The room had napkins, forks, plates and cups. It was perfect and it was truly turnkey. I am thoroughly satisfied with the birthday party we had at Sea Bowl. It was so fun that I'm considering doing my own birthday there next year! I highly recommend it, it was a really great experience!",
            "Yelp says it was open on Christmas Eve 12/24. and we drove all there they were closed! We were here before on Christmas Eve to celebrate my sons birthday. Now No one pick up calls when we call ahead of time.  Very disappointed it's my sons birthday al",
            "Tell me how does a kitchen run out of food? Staff were rude. I wouldn't recommend place to anybody to come to this place at all. Also the assistant manager hadn't help my friend, he discriminated him for asking for food but was not served at all. Only people around him were served. If you want to have fun, don't come here at all.",
            "Bad assistance, they give us the pager but they didn't call us, the lanes were available. Very disappointed, wrong information, Rude staff didn't help at all.",
            "Would give zero if I could. I waited for a hour for a lane, and only after they said we had a limit per lane, even if the extra person would only watch. The staff was rude about it and didn't try to help. Don't recommend coming. Very stressful",
            "I'm here for the first time, the place is sufficiently big and we didn't have to wait. I really enjoyed the hour we spent here. The food is okay, not many options for a vegetarian. They charge 50$ per lane per hour. There is bar so you can get drinks as well. I really liked the arcade, where you can sit after you're done with the game and just chill.",
            "Thank you Sea Bowl, for not having changed much over the years!! I grew up bowling in the Yay Area and when Japantown Bowl closed years ago and then Serra Bowl bit the dust fairly recently i was sad that those childhood haunts of mine were gone. I'm not really a huge fan of those new bowling joints (ehem, Lucky Strike) - to me, it just doesn't feel like \"real\" bowling, feels more like a bougie-boug bar that happens to have bowling as a drinking activity. Anyway I'm super happy that Sea Bowl is still around and that it is still the same ol' place really, after all these years. Reasonable prices for bowling, drinks, and food (the food is actually pretty good, especially the nachos), and of course the requisite bowling alley arcade. Plenty of parking, plenty of lanes, and the fresh sea air and sunset views are so refreshing for a City dweller such as myself. It's a short jaunt away from SF and i always get that comforting sensation that i'm really escaping the city chaos. We recently rented 5 lanes for a birthday party on a Monday night and everyone had a great time.",
            "Awesome bowling alley.  Haven't got a locker here yet because Bel Mateo Bowl thew away all my equipment, but went here anyway to check the lanes.  I grew up at Kings bowl and love them too, but live too far now.  Kevin thought me the \"hook\".  I'm joining a league here soon.  Their administration told me they call you if you owe money and wont throw your equipment away so I'm sold!",
            "Ok yes so this place is pretty much out in the middle of no where right next to the ocean but it is defiantly worth checking out at least once or twice! This place is HUGE! They have so many lanes, a huge parking lot, a party room that you can rent out, a small arcade, clean bathrooms and a decent sized cafe! The customer service is great and they are all so nice! The place is also kept clean which is always important to mention in a review right? It is also close to the ocean and you are able to get there with a quick walk! Like I said, it is well out of your but it is well worth the visit! Come check them out!",
            "I gotten pretty serious about bowling recently, and your website states single games on weekdays till 6:00pm. Came in today at 5:35 with my buddy for a game but was told they only offer hourly. Young blonde kid with glasses, you've lost 2 regulars",
            "A really modern, clean and well run bowling alley just across the road from the beach in Pacifica. Didn't expect much, but this place delivers with modern scoring (including automatic bumpers), friendly staff, clean bathrooms, snack bar / restaurant and a really bright, open feel. Some bowling alleys can feel old, dark and stinky...  This place is just the opposite. Really nice. Lots of parking in a big lot and also shares its lot with a credible restaurant (The Surf Spot) if you don't want to take advantage of the snack bar.Glad to have this spot here and we'll be back!!",
            "Fun place to go with friends or with a date. Our lane kept getting messed up and It kept happening. (the pins wouldn't reset themselves) It started to get a bit annoying. The reason I'm  giving them 5 stars is because the staff was very empathetic and listened to all of our concerns. The staff was very busy running around putting out other fires, so it was hard to track them down at times.  When we were finished playing the manager approached us and gave our entire party a handful tickets for a free game of bowling.  It's this sort of customer service that warrants 5 stars. (Hopefully they'll have that issue fixed next time!) The ambiance is cool, they have a good bar with Karaoke. Food is decent with an array of fried goodies and pizzas.   Customer service? Aces.",
            "We went to Sea Bowl the day after we bowled at Classic Bowling Alley.  The bowling alleys are about 20 minutes apart, but stars apart in terms of, well, everything!Sea Bowl is located on the Coast Highway, has a large parking lot, and a snack bar area with floor to ceiling glass windows that provides an ocean view.  My husband and I sat in here while our daughter and niece went to play video games (small arcade, but they found a way to spend about $10 and stay entertained.We paid for an hour of bowling, got our shoes (they run small here, consider asking for a half to full size up, I went full size and the fit was fine), and headed for our assigned alley.   As my husband was programming the score board, we were approached by what I would describe as a \"bowling valet\".  He showed us how to program the screen, helped us with getting a bowling ball in the correct weight and hole size (ever realized that bowling alley balls have various hole sizes), and even found different colors for the girls so they could tell their balls apart on appearance.While we were bowling, the \"bowling valet\" returned with a pitcher of water and cups, then brought us a tub to deposit our bowling shoes in when we finished.  I noticed that this was something that took place all over the alley, not just at the lanes where parties were going on.  What service!The alley is very clean and well maintained.  The screens can be adjusted to various themes (ocean background), and there is plenty of seating for the entire party to be seated at the same time (I haven't found that at all alleys).  They have many bowling stands (used for young children and disabled persons) available, I saw at least five in use while we were there.We really enjoyed our time there, if we hadn't had dinner reservations, we would have stayed longer.  The snack bar has many options, along with a bar area for those over 21.There was only one issue that I had with Sea Bowl.  They have a policy (it's printed and highlighted on the form they give you with your alley assignment) of only allowing those 10 and under to have the bumper feature (keeps the bowling ball from going into the gutter).  I went to the front desk to ask why this was a policy of theirs, as I have never encountered this before.  Their response was that adults use heavier bowling balls and have a harder throw than children.  The combined weight and force can damage the bumpers.  My personal feeling is that this should be a policy that applies to a specific bowling ball size.  My daughter was bowling with a 10 pound ball and I was using a 9 pound ball, yet she could have bumpers.  While this ticked me off when we first arrived, I decided to not factor that into my score.  (As an adult who doesn't bowl a whole lot, and does it for fun, I prefer the bumpers.  It's not a lot of fun watching your ball hit the gutter 40% of the time, especially when you are the one paying).  They made an age exception for my niece because she uses a very small ball, and I spoke to the front desk to get my daughter exempted, too (she's past the age 10 limit, but has some emotional issues, the front desk was very accommodations when I explained our situation).Sea Bowl, if you are reading this, I hope you'll reconsider your policy.  It just makes for a more enjoyable experience for everyone.",
            "I was excited to take mine and my buddy kids bowling here. The place has a very cool retro vibe, a cool bar, nice lanes, but that is where the positives end. While we were waiting for our lane, my buddy and I checked out the bar. First disappointment was everything had to be in plastic cups. Martinis somehow do not taste as good in an unchilled plastic cup. So our lane was ready and we got everyone shoe'd up. There was a guy who found balls for us all. That was a positive. But, after 3 out of 6 of us bowled our 10th frame, our hour was up, and the scoreboard said that we had to see front desk to add time. We were just bowling the one game so I went up and spoke to one of the people manning the front desk. I asked if the last 3 bowlers could bowl their 10th frame. Pretty simple request. The person I spoke to had the worst customer service skills. Was not able to make a decision, there was no manager around, so we finally just left. We spent about $200 on bowling, food, drinks and the arcade. We will not be back. Next time will go back to Bel-Mateo Bowl...."

            "Great spot for izakaya (Japanese tapas) and yakitori (grilled skewers). And, oh my goodness, the ambiance is chic! They have the sunken floor seating a.k.a. horigotatsu, and I love how the red cushions contrast against the dark wooden floors and tables. In addition, they have a whole shelf of sake and shochu. For those who don't know, shochu is Japan's notable distilled liquor and can be made from sweet potato, rice, or barley. We opted for the yuzu shochu and the green tea shochu cocktails. I highly recommend the yuzu shochu cocktail since it's the perfect balance of sour and sweet and goes down nicely.Food-wise, the grilled whole squid (ika sugata yaki) with spicy Japanese mayo and the wagyu beef are a must. If you're looking for something different, I would also recommend the monkfish liver and the fried kawa (crispy chicken skin). And if you're looking for something really different, they serve exotic meats on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Some things I wasn't crazy about: I didn't feel like there was much variety in sauces. The monkfish liver, oysters, and fried kawa all used the same sauce (ponzu?). The spicy garlic miso ramen was neither spicy, nor flavorful; just oily. Still, I would recommend checking it out for the ambiance alone. It's one of the few places that actually have the horigotatsu seating and it's got a sizeable selection of liquor, izakaya, and yakitori to enjoy. Bring some friends. You get a free bottle of sake if you have a group of four or more and show up after 11 PM.",
            "We really wanted to like this place for the cute, intimate ambiance and large selection of alcohol and food but service was just too mediocre. I'll start with the positives, everything we ordered was fairly good and the food runner was friendly. We opted for the bacon wrapped quail eggs, beef tendon, potato croquette, duck breast, pork belly, kurobota sausage and another that I forgot. The sausage was supposedly spicy but it tasted pretty normal, and the pork belly was overly chewy. We really liked the tako wasabi though, I definitely recommend that.Our waitress tonight was a girl with blue contacts who seemed cold and uninviting to start. I felt the weird vibe when she answered all my questions super awkwardly, especially when I asked about the free beer with check-in. She didn't seem knowledgable about the menu nor did she check up on us, ask if we wanted to order more food/drinks, or deliver the check. I asked her what chicken gristle was since it's on the menu and she just said \"Uhh I don't know.\" I know that japanese restaurants sometimes do pooled tip and everyone has equal responsibility over all the tables so maybe it was just an off night. But I definitely shouldn't get the vibe that I'm bothering my server when I ask to order 2 more things lolI also don't wanna complain about free beer but they were extremely flat and came to our table looking like someone already drank both. No foam whatsoever and the cup was missing like an inch from the top, wish I took a picture. All in all the experience was a little too meh for us to return",
            "Located less than 10 mins from the airport this is a must dine spot in the area. It's traditional with no shoes and  seating tatami floors. They feature these large thick glass walls as dividers between diners. My friend and I shared the tonkatsu ramen, beef tongue, snake, boars skewers, and takoyaki. The ramen was perfect with thick noodles and a strong broth. Not too salty with 2 thick cuts of pork and an gooey egg. Wednesday- Thursday night they have specials on the exotic animals so we decided to give them a try. The snake and boar skewers we're interesting. Tough meat perfectly grilled and provided great texture. My friend and I definitely enjoyed our experience here. The menu has all types of meats, soups and entrees to choose from. Taste wise it's very authentic and fairly priced. If you love Japanese and yakitori this is the spot!",
            "Such a fun spot for yakitori and tapas! You wouldn't expect the place to be so cool and hip on the inside based on the appearance of the super small plaza where it's located. The parking lot is TINY so for those staying around the area, I highly recommend getting an Uber or walking here. The restaurant is surprisingly large in side and very modern. It gives off strong bar/club vibes with extra dim lighting and club music. You're asked to take your shoes off before being seated at sunken Japanese tables. Large glass panes separate each table and offer some privacy. Great spot for a fun and more intimate dinner or date.The menus (both food and drink) are a little overwhelming. If you're only getting yakitori, they recommend about 10 per person. We mixed it up and got 12 yakitori and vegetables skewers + some tapas. It's pretty difficult knowing exactly how much food to order. Would have been helpful to have the prices listed on the order list as you check items off.Highly recommend the chicken karaage tapas, wagyu beef yakitori, chicken thigh with spicy mayo yakitori, and shishitou pepper kushiyaki. Our least favorites were the wagyu beef tataki tapas, pork cheek yakitori, and bacon wrapped quail egg yakitori. Each order is just one skewer so portion size isn't huge but it adds up quickly.Service was okay. I thought it'd be better since we came at 5PM on a Monday and the place was basically empty. By the time we left at 6:30PM though, there was a wait to get seated so make a reservation if you can. Would come back again if I find myself in the area!",
            "This is one of the few places focused on yakitori and it is delicious, but could improve in some aspects.When we first walked in (2pm on a saturday) there was no one at the front and we waited for  a while to be seated even though the restaurant was fairly empty. I had no problem with this because the waiters were friendly and got us seated right away. I was impressed with the private suites separated by glass walls because they were very traditional and you could not hear conversations being held in the other suites. In addition you must take off your shoes before entering the suite so it's a good idea to wear socks. Also at each table there are small cards stating that if you check in at their restaurant on Instagram or Facebook you can get a free beer,, drink, or edamame (such a great deal!)Now the food. We had an assorted selection of skewers including chicken skin,spicy and sweet wagyu, spicy and regular pork belly, duck breast, chicken leg with spicy mayo, and quail egg wrapped in bacon. Each was delicious in their own way (5/5). One thing to remember is that each skewer cost from $3-$5 so it may seem like you have to spend alot, but you can easily become filled with 3-4 skewers.However I was not completely filled after sharing the skewers so I had Tonkatsu ramen(3/5). It was decent to say the least. The business is more known for their yakitori so I wont judge the ramen so harshly, but if they worked on fixing the presentation of the ramen instead of simply putting everything into a bowl, it might make up for the little amount of noodles and mild pork flavored broth. Now the service is where I think a small adjustment could really make this place great! The time we arrived was particularly slow so the waiters/hostess did not seem like they had much to do (unless they were working the back too, then my apologies). We waited for a long time to get the check and to order a second set of food. It honestly would have been helpful to have maybe one staff to circle around the dining area more frequently so we would not have to wait and ask what seemed like the owner for the check. Other than that, when the servers did come to our attention they were helpful and very kind.Overall, this is a nice place to come for a special occasion since the aesthetic is traditional Japanese and the food is delicious!",
            "This place was packed for dinner on a Thursday night but that did not change the quality of our meal. We tried a variety of yakitori, meat skewers, and if I'm being honest none of them disappointed!The kitchen was very packed so they brought out a complementary bowl of edamame, as well as complementary purple yam chips which I thought demonstrated great attention to service.We tried: Bacon wrapped in cherry tomatoes, bacon wrapped in quail eggs, bacon wrapped in mushrooms, sausages, basically all the wagyu beef skewers, chicken karaage, seaweed salad, regular salad, squid, chicken gizzards, chicken skewers, etc., we even tried rattlesnake!We ordered two spicy black garlic Ramen, one tonkotsu Ramen, and one miso Ramen. The Ramen's were alright, I found the broth to be very watery and it did not have many bold flavors. The garlic Ramen tasted A LOT like garlic, that was my favorite. But truthfully, this didn't bother me because this location is not known for their Ramen anyways and I was more excited to try the different yakitori.No dish was worse than the other; all were incredibly cooked and seasoned. The meat was so tender and they fall apart in your mouth; I highly recommend all of these dishes if you are curious about them. I definitely want to come back and try more of the exotic meats in the future.",
            "This place is so amazing! Ive been looking for Yakitori in such a long time and I'm so lucky that I found this spot even I don't live in San Fransisco but I would come back! On Wednesday's and Thursdays they have Exotic meat specials but they were out of most of the meats and it's little pricy but I'm sure it's worth it! I tried the Tonkotsu ramen as well as several different skewers. They were all so so amazing! So tasty! I can't even describe how they tasted! You have to try this place yourself!The atmosphere is so great and relaxing! Great for taking your date! Little noisy tho! The ramen soup was good too but I feel I had a better ramen before elsewhere but it was still good.  The peach sake was pretty tasty and cool as well it came with jelly.",
            "A good friend of ours wanted to have lunch here at Mokutanya Izakaya in Burlingame. Yup, this is the first time we were in Burlingame and we trusted our (foodie) friend with her pick. We ordered a bunch of tapas. My favorite was the Japanese sausages. They were so tasty! Everything was great. We also ordered oysters, but I didn't care for them as I was enjoying the grilled meats! There was no wait as we made a reservation (just in case). Although, it was so hard to find parking! It was just a small shared parking lot that only fits a few cars. We had to drive around and found parking on the street. By the way, the parking meters around there didn't take card... COINS ONLY! Yup, the day we both didn't have enough coins and had to run around trying to break our bill. About their bathroom: my husband used it and shook his head when I asked if I should use it before leaving. So 4 stars are literally for their food and private space.",
            "Tapas and drinks ?? yes ! Perfect for a date night since the the lights are dim and they provide a candle per table. It's a japanese setting where you take off your shoes. COST: $$$ Not too pricey per item but those items add up to a lot ! Probably $70 per person with drinks RESERVATIONS: yes and they have happy hour on certain days so if you want $1 dollar oysters, this place offers it on Monday and Tuesdays ! SERVICE: the best, our server was very attentive and knew what to recommend (:FOOD:  you can't go wrong with anything here. We ordered bacon wrapped asparagus and quail egg, hamachi and waygu carpaccio, beef tongue ( one of my favorites ) chicken liver, chicken wings, and oysters ! All were super delicious ! DESSERT: matcha cheesecake (5/5) the perfect amount of sweetness with chocolate drizzle on the side DRINKS: peach sparkling sake with jelly comes in a can but they pour it into a wine glass for you. (5/5)",
            "In A Nutshell:-Mokutanya is a hidden-secret for many people I know.-This tiny restaurant is tucked away in a small business nook in Burlingame, CA.-As soon as you walk inside you can take a photo-op w/ their \"step & repeat\" wall paper on the left.-When you walk inside to be seated, you'll see many sectioned-off areas w/ glass enclosures that block out the noise, but not the sights.-Please take off your shoes, as in Japanese custom before you sit down.-The food here is very, very good and always shareable.-My philosophy is to order as much as you can possibly eat and to try as much as possible.-The sake clam soup is to die for, so order that.-I also enjoyed the crispy hamachi kama (hamachi collar) too.Overall, I'll be honest, just order everything on the menu!",
            "Who drives from Oakland to Burlingame on a weekday just for dinner?? Apparently, a lot of people do.  I don't really yakitori much and I've only tried it once in a small hole-in-the-wall in SF.  It was decent and I can totally see how yakitoris can be a late night favorite especially with a few bottles of sake.  Mokutanya isn't your average mom and pop yakitori joint.  It doesn't have chipped wooden tables with lopsided leg stands.  They don't have random posters/ads/business cards stapled on walls.  No elbow to elbow, eavesdropping of other guests conversations.  Mokutanya is hip, modern, and just overall amazing.  We ordered quite a few yakitoris, oysters, and carpaccio.  Everything was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned.  We also ordered three bottles of sake.  Pro tip: get the coconut flavor, ZOMG.  The interior is super modern but they still kept it somewhat traditional.  Upon being seated, you are asked to remove your shoes.  I was super comfortable and decided to walk to the restroom without my shoes.  It's a personal choice but if you're concerned about getting herpes on your feet, by all means, put yo shoes back on.Will definitely recommend to friends.  Service was awesome.  An extra star goes to their music selections *swoon*",
            "Take your shoes off and stay awhile.  No, really!  Japanese style seating with sunken tables enclosed in glass walls.  It's beautiful, and a little like being in a fishbowl.  It just might be the best experience of Burlingame.  Warning: come with your loved one (it's romantic), or at least an experience with co-workers, but absolutely positively not by yourself (me, me, me!).Sake up to $1,400/bottle, and they have 50 kinds starting from $8 (whew).   Along with the usual suspects, they have all kinds of wild meats: peacock, iguana, venison, alligator, buffalo, silkworm, swan, camel, and even bobcat.  Where's your sense of adventure?I tried a smattering of items: spinach goma-ae salad [$10, 4.5 stars], lobster tails [$24, 3.5 stars], kawa/grilled chicken skin [$3, 2.0 stars], fried kawa/chicken skin [$4, 2.5 stars], sweet wagu [$5, 5.0 stars], spicy wagu [$5, 4.5 stars], gindara kasuzuke/black cod [$5, 4.0 stars], bacon-wrapped eggplant [$4, 3.0 stars[, grilled Nootka oysters [$15 for 4 pcs. 4.0 stars].  I washed it all down with amazing iced green tea [$3, 5.0 stars], and kizakura coconut nigori [$14, 4.5 stars]** Best of the Night: sweet wagu skewer, so so good. I'd order a few of these with some rice and be very happy.** Worst of the Night: chicken skins, both the grilled and fried.  Instead of delicious crispy-heaven, they fold raw chicken skin so tight like an accordion and cook it.  The result, cooked on the outside and soft on the majority of the inside.  No good.  They re-made them for me, and still inedible.Lindsey and team are terrific, happy and provide great service with smile and a joyous attitude.",
            "Came here for lunch today and ordered the following:Black cod, great 5 starsBaby tako fried octopus, great 5 starsWagyu Beef salt & pepper, great 5 starsWagyu Beef spicy, great 5 starsSmoked eggplant, good 4 starsSmelt, ok 3 starsNagaimo, good 4 starsShiitake mushroom, good 4 starsChicken wings, good 4 starsTonkatsu ramen 3 starsSpicy beef ramen 4 starsUnagi, 4 stars goodGreat place for yakitori but ramen was just ok.",
            "Parking: Their plaza is superrrr small. You'll have to look for street parking near the area! Wait Time: RESERVATIONS ARE A MUSTT! Just call the store and make a reservation with the host. It was super easy and quick!Even then, we will waited about 15-20min for our table to clear up and leave.Menu Items: They have a variety of foods but a big chunk of their menu is made up of skewers. I definitely recommend that you order (1) of each skewer so that you can try multiple. You order everything on a piece of paper. I recommend filling out the form earlier on if you're waiting in line. My Experience: Here are some of my favorite highlights from my meal: - Wagyu Beef (Spicy) Skewer: 5/5, amaaaazing! Must. Try. It's tender and has a nice kick of spice to it. I ordered another one because it was my favorite. - Smelt Skewer: 4.5/5, there was a nice crunch to it. - Fried Baby Tako: 5/5!! Oh my god I loved it so much. Awesome appetizer to start the meal. It's crunchy and just overall delicious - Monkfish Liver: 5/5, I'm usually not a fan of it, but it was so fresh and tasty I couldn't resist LOL- Spicy Black Garlic Ramen: 4/5, Flavorful! My biggest regret: not getting any of the bacon wrapped skewers....... lol I got the shitaki mushroom skewer (2/5) and I did not like that :(Service: Allison was our server and she was super great. She was quick with our order and gave us updates on when some parts of our order look longer to come out. We also got a slice of bday cake for my bf's birthday on the house!! Conclusion: we definitely will be back!",
            "TLDR: Unique ambience, delicously different food, perfect date spot! Randomly picked this spot for dinner because this was one of the only few restaurants open past 10 pm in Burlingame.Best decision ever! The ambience is so unique! They have glass walled cubicles with tables burrowed inside the floor. So it looks like you are seated on the floor.. but you don't have to cross your legs! So cool. The food is great! We ordered the following skewers: Chicken liver, Bacon wrapped eggplant, spicy wagyu beef, lamb chop, spicy mayonnaise chicken.The chicken liver and the spicy wagyu beef were my favorites.Also ordered the cold ramen, which is basically noodles with no broth. This was a bit bland for my taste, it could have come with more toppings.They have a special offer on Tuesdays: 1 dollar oysters. Hell ya! Got that too.If you checkin to Instagram or Facebook, you get a free beer or free edamame. We ended our meal with the chocolate pudding dessert, which was plated to perfection and melted in our mouths.The service here is a bit slow and you might need a reservation to get in on fridays/ weekends, it was pretty crowded even on a Tuesday when I went. A very unique spot to take a date to if you are looking for something different!",
            "The atmosphere is fun and different! You have to take your shoes off and sit on little cushions on the floor. The table is low to the ground, but very comfortable. I really enjoyed their spicy ramen and quail eggs! I decided to also try various meats (sausage, bacon quail eggs, and beef) on skewers and they were well seasoned and prepared perfectly! Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable.",
            "Fun place to get some grilled meats and beer with friends! Decor is a bit interesting with the clear glass \"rooms\". You take off your shoes and sit on the floor- feels like it could be Japan! Only thing missing is the slippers they usually provide you. We made last minute reservations on a Sat and they were still able to accommodate us. The bill adds up here very quickly when you keep ordering yakitoris and sake/soju. But everything was pretty delicious! Definitely recommend!",
            "Service is below any possible standards. Ordered 2 appetizers, soup, 6 skewers, rice, and oysters.  Oysters never arrived, rice never arrived, 30 min into the dinner started chasing server and finally soup arrived, then slowly the skewers arrived, and then silence, had to ask again for the appetizers and missing skewers,  and they brought them. Told to cancel rice and oysters. Noticed that waiters were constantly coming over to people asking if they received all what they ordered, of if other waiter took their order, disorganized. Time wasted",
            "My friend made reservations for this place on a Friday at 6PM.  When we arrived it was already super full and packed.  Unfortunately we weren't able to sit in the tatami section where you're required to take your shoes off. With that being said, the atmosphere inside was really nice.  It's pretty dim in there so it gives off a bit of a romantic vibe.  The hostess brought us to the table and we sat down.  We were then given water and the waitress gave us some recommendations of what was good there.  We ended up ordering: butabara (pork belly), gyutan (cow tongue), pork cheek, quail egg wrapped in bacon, wagyu beef (cubed, spicy, and sweet), Gindara Kasuzuki, and a little fish with fish eggs in it. The food was really good, everything was super tasty.  My favorite out of all of these skewers was probably the gyutan.  The flavor was on point and the texture of the meat was perfect!  The spicy wagyu beef was a little too spicy for me but the sweet one was delicious!  The service there was really good, what made me a bit upset is that we placed two separate orders but our second order came first. When we asked the waitress about it, she said it wasn't placed.  So that was a bit of a bummer.  But eventually we got it.So, I would say this was a good experience here.  Next time when i come back i do want to experience the tatami room~~!",
            "Reservation should be made, because even though we had one for 8:45, we weren't seated till about 9. Once we were seated, we were instructed to remove our shoes, and enter a glass room that we were given all to ourselves. Music was cool, ambiance was right, there was even a little slit in the wall to watch the chefs grill your skewers. We were given the menus, a drink menu, and a paper menu we were to fill out with the quantity of certain types of foods we wanted. I ordered the 'Ebi Fried' for a tapas, miso soup, lobster and bacon wrapped asaparagus as my skewers; with a side of rice. It was absolutely delicious, I mean.. I had to order more.. I order the Wagyu Beef (Sweet) and the Spicy Pork Belly skewer... which were soooo good, especially that wagyu beef. Overall, friendly staff, great atmosphere. I don't even mind that we were sat late, I get that people don't want to leave... I didn't either! 5 Stars all the way."

            "This place is packed with locals and easy to understand. Waitresses were great, attentive and certainly not overbearing. Was there on a Tuesday night with my wife. She had the Salmon ravioli and I had the pasta calabrese (homemade and very good slightly spicy pork sausage). Shared a Caesar salad which was also up to par - very fresh.Extensive wine list with many Italian wines (bit overpriced) but also many local wines and very reasonable house wines. Specialty house cocktail not much to write home about.",
            "Came here on a Sunday night with the hubby. Our waiter was extremely nice and attentive. We ordered a couple of drinks after he recommended a nice wine to go alone with my steak. For appetizer we had the calamari, it was average, my husband said it had a certain smell to it which he didn't enjoy but I though it was ok. My husband ordered a pasta which was a little bland for our taste. I ordered a steak, cooked how I like it but the plate seemed a little oily, not sure if it was due to the chimichurry sauce. We had finished our drinks and decided to get a bottle of the moscato my husband had, the waiter brought out the bottle and poured us each a glass. It wasn't until I had a sip of the drink that I realized that it was the wrong drink, I brought it up to our waiter who immediately apologized and brought us the correct bottle. Lastly for dessert we had the lava cake and creme burlee those were amazing! Overall the service was a solid 4 star, appetizer and main dish were a solid 3 stars and the desserts were a solid 5 star.",
            "At first impression I thought would be just another American/Italian restaurant due to building appearance from outside.As I ordered my appetizer things started to change.The presentation was great and tasty followed by main entree which was very well prepared.I also learned the building is an old part of town and was remodeled to its current looks.Staff was 10 out of 10.",
            "First let me start by saying this restaurant is a Gem.  We got right in a few minutes before our reservation time at 6:15.  The service was really great.So the evening started with some wonderful bread and butter.  The next item up was the Caesar Salad.  This was very fresh and full of flavor.  If you like Caesar salads this is a place to get a good one.Up next was the Lasagna alla Bolognese.  It did take the fifteen minutes (probably more like 20 but no big deal) as the wife and I had some very good conversation. One which was of how this dish should be arriving Piping Hot when it does arrive.  We both mentioned how we should be very careful as to not burn our Palate or our tongues.  When it did arrive the presentation was to perfection.  Along with some fresh Parmesan cheese to top it off.  So we split this entree in half.  To our dismay the first bit was a shock to both of us.  It was only lukewarm. You could eat this with out any of the concerns we had with the temperature of this dish.  As we continued onward I encountered a Cold spot in mine half.  As I mentioned this to my wife as few bites later she encountered the same thing.  We both did really enjoy the rich and amazing flavors of this dish.  So as a previous cook and restaurant manager I had to say something to someone.  So I asked to speak to the restaurant manager.  When he arrived I informed him about the temperature of our entree.  About how a dish that takes fifteen minutes or longer to make should arrive piping hot which it did not.  I mentioned to him that if guests do not inform staff or management about situations in their establishment they cannot correct them.  He was very receptive to what we had to say.  He said that he was going to look into this situation.  He even mentioned that this dish is cooked at 600 degrees and can not see how this happened.  He also said that he was going to cook one him self and check the temperature after it get finished.  I am Absolutely sure that this will not happen again (see continued comments below).We were not expecting any type of money off of our bill but to our dismay the entree was Comped (did not charge us) even though we literally almost completely cleaned the plates with our bread.  Now this is how a restaurant is supposed to and used to be operated.  Some still do not do it this way.  In closing I would like to give a big shout out to the restaurant manager Omar.  You are fantastic and still one of the rare breed type of managers who know how to take care of your guests.I would highly recommend this establishment if you like Great Italian food.  Oh by the way some of their pastas and sausages are homemade too.Way to go Omar",
            "This restaurant is definitely a great date spot! I checked out this place on Yelp because of the great reviews I read. The standards were definitely above what I was expecting. The service was great, the food was great and the cocktails was great!We had a party of 12 people and ordered a list of things. We had appetizer, a bunch of entreés, and desserts. Personally I had a bunch of appetizer's to try, my entreé was the prawns, and for dessert I had a creme brulee. Everything was fantastic! Definitely will be back! Keep up the good work!",
            "My son & I had lunch here Sunday afternoon for his birthday. Had to wait a little bit, but didn't have reservations and they were pretty busy. We both had the Linguini della baia, which was delicious! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce and seafood was very flavorful. The Caesar salad was nothing special. The house wine was good. Service was pretty good, but a little slow.  I would eat here again.",
            "Came for the Valentine Day fixed menu. Lots of options on the menu. My husband had the seafood salad for first course. He was very happy with it. I'm not a huge fan of octopus but it was tender and had a nice citrus bite. I had the prosciutto and fruit. They used papaya. It was not ripe enough. Wish they had used honeydew. Oh well. The plating was very unattractive. They used the prosciutto like a blanket to cover up the fruit and a couple of olives. The entrees were very good. Husband had the seafood linguine. Loaded with seafood. He ate every bite. I had the veal picatta. The veal was tender and moist. Excellent cook on it. The sauce had the right amount of citrus tang. The augratin potatoes were amazing. Melt in your mouth good.Hubs had the tiramisu. Excellent. I had them fix me some fruit with whipped cream. I have to watch my sugars. Unfortunately, they served the same unripe papaya. Fortunately, they added some strawberries. The whipped cream was heavenly.The one fail was the price of drinks. I had a martini, which was very well made. My hubs had 2 double scotch on the rocks. My martini was $10. One of his scotches was $28. We aren't cheap types but that price was shocking. It was no special scotch. Glenlivet. We will definitely return. I look forward to sampling their entire menu. The service was great and the food was good. Parking is sketchy but oh well. Next visit my husband will just order martinis.  LOL.",
            "Really nice servers and tasty food. I go here whenever I visit my relatives in Half Moon Bay. It's conveniently located next to Old Princeton Landing, should you want drinks/music after dinner here at Mezza Luna.I do think that their wine selection is not great (in quantity, for the lower-end wines)-- you could find better wines at Trader Joe's than the $28 bottle of Pinot Noir we ordered.",
            "We decided to try this restaurant for my husband's birthday. Upon entry to the restaurant, we loved the ambience of it and felt like it was a great first sign of our choice. My husband is Korean and he tends to enjoy other cuisines less than our son and I. We ordered garlic bread and antipasto Italiano as starters. Son wanted pizza, I ordered homemade fettuccine alfredo (lots of  homemade pasta choices) and hubby went with linguine baia that attracted him from food pictures of other Yelpers. The food were all amazing! We ended with tiramisu and it's a perfect celebration meal! Another highlight of the experience, our server, Guillermo, is one of the best we have ever had. Professional, courteous, friendly, attentive to details, big smiles, and it just brought our dining experience to another level.",
            "This is a great little place. The hostess sat us right away. We had a server straight from Sicily. He gave great suggestions. It was overall a good experience. Their bread is made from scratch and amazing! So refreshing having an Italian restaurant actually serve bread. And not charge you extra either. These CA restaurants typically think way too highly of themselves, I've learned. But not this place! They're open for lunch too! Anyways, we had the duck special which was good but not amazing. We also had the lasagna. And we loved that! We wanted to order one Togo but they take more time to cook so we weren't able. We took a dessert home and it was not great. Kind of wasted calories, in my opinion. But the bread and lasagna, paired with a great server--allows this place to earn 4 Stars from me!! We will be back! For the lasagna and the bread!!",
            "This is the best Italian food on the coast. The service, the presentation, the quality and the ambiance are all top notch.  My guest and I were blown away with our experience. My biggest problem was parking! It was crowded and busyI had the special manicotti and to say it melted in my mouth doesn't do it justice. My guest had the house made sausage with penne pasta in a bolognaise sauce. Needless to say she was in pasta heaven!! Desert? Oh yes we shared a chocolate pie/cake thing-shouldn't have shared-should of had one each!",
            "We drive all the way into HMB for this restaurant! It's amazing. The salads, the pastas, the meats and desserts are all wonderful. Great flavor yet delicate and not heavy. I love scallops and they often offer specials with local ingredients such as sea scallops or vegetables grown locally. We highly recommend this restaurant. Prices are reasonable for such quality, so give them a try!",
            "We spent the weekend in the area and chose to try Mezza Luna because we were in the mood for Italian. I wasn't impressed with the low-energy greeting upon checking into our reservation. Our waiter was even less impressive. When I asked for recommendations and had questions about a few items off the menu, he seemed uninterested and impartial to everything. All I got was a couple shrugs and no help. Onto the food. I ordered myself the fettuccini alfredo with chicken, which is a dish that is common enough that you would think they would have a decent recipe for. The alfredo sauce was lacking in flavor. The chicken was bland and poorly, or not seasoned, at all. It came chopped into cubes and tasted like it was boiled. I also tried some of the seafood linguini. This was better than the fettuccini alfredo, but that's as much as I have to say about it as it was also quite uninspiring and lacking in the taste department. The ingredients for both dishes are subpar and unoriginal. Finally, when we tried to order the \"signature chocolate dessert\", we were told the kitchen has shut down and can't make that item. It would've been nice (or courteous) to know the kitchen was closing beforehand so that we could've placed our order. So we settled for the cream filled beignets, which once again was nothing to write home about. It tasted stale and looked like an afterthought on the menu.As much as I wanted to love this place since it was a celebratory dinner (which we put under the reservation but had no mention from any staff), it just wasn't a great Italian dining experience. I'd say Mezza Luna is a convenient place to eat if you're in the area, but if you're willing to drive a bit, there are certainly many other Italian restaurants that are willing to do more with their efforts in providing a proper dining experience.",
            "This is a competent locally TOO popular Italian restaurant. We visited last night Tuesday Jan 7th The service is painfully slow and manic at times. I had the white bean soup it was perfect. My spaghetti and meatballs were slightly better than Chef Boyardee and was tied with Olive Garden. The  linguini Bolognase was very good and the sauce was meaty. Next time I want Italian food I'll buy a pint of Gelato and eat it until my craving passes. Or if I'm willing to wait as long as eating at this place, I'd catch a flight to Rome.",
            "I would give this place 6 stars if I could! Make a reservation for sure because it gets busy. The servers here are all so nice! The food comes out fast, and it is mm, mm, good! We had the Caesar salad, shrimp arribiata, and seafood pasta. The Caesar was simple and well done, croutons were crunchyliscious and dressing was creamy with not too much anchovy taste (I don't like anchovies, and I loved their salad). Shrimp pasta is my go to at most Italian places, but the one here was one of the best I've had. I love that they did it with a nice, spicy arribiata sauce, and the shrimp were perfectly cooked (plus the tails were already removed). I could eat that plate every day. My bf said his seafood pasta, which had clams, mussels, octopus and other stuff in it, was amazing. Since I don't like most shellfish, I didn't try it, but I trust his judgment ;) I also loved the house Pinot Noir they have. Most times, I am not a fan of the house wines restaurants have, but this one was smooth and fruit forward without being too sweet. Highly recommended! I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in town!",
            "The food was ok the waiter was great. I had gnocchi w/gorgonzola sauce. The sauce was not very good and tasted like a white Velveta cheese with-a little gorgonzola added. I also had a caesar salad & unfortunately is was not good. I really wanted this place to be good & not just a tourist trap.",
            "This restaurant is our favorite for any occasion, the service is always on point, the food is always delicious, and the ambiance is romantic with a fireplace to boot!",
            "I couldn't wait to come here for my sons birthday and celebrate. EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED!!It wait empty and yet we had to call out for service, all the staff was huddled around  near the kitchen. I had to call out several times, I said HELLO anyone here ? We would have ordered several rounds of drinks but what a turn off. No one to take our order.TERRIBLE SERVICE. We had dinner here many times in the past and the food was great. I feel terrible to have recommended this restaurant EVERYTHING was terrible. Our family members have moved to Half Moon Bay and that's also the reason we came.WE WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN.",
            "Doesn't get much better than here. We come here every time we are in town. Staff is very professional and courteous and you cannot beat the location. View of the Harbor is a perfect dining experience.The food is absolutely amazing. Bread to each table is always a great place to start. Every dish we have had here from the pastas to the pizza is perfect.",
            "I will start by saying that I am a bit bias because this place hold a special place in my heart. It was one of my Grandpa's favorite restaurants and we actually held his memorial service here last year. So this year we chose to come for mothers day brunch and my experience was once again top notch. I feel so at home here. The drinks and food are really good, but my favorite by far is the Linguine della Baia , to die for ! Service is always friendly and attentive."

            "We had SUCH a great meal when we were in Half Moon Bay over New Years. We didn't have reservations but they found us a cute, quiet table tucked away. Service was attentive but not overbearing and the owner even stopped us on our way out to make sure everything had been okay.We shared the eggplant parmesan and a daily special - mushroom and scallop risotto. Both were great. We liked everything so much we actually stopped by later in the week to grab a pizza to go and I will say it wasn't as good as our dinner. So, I'd recommend either staying away from the pizza or just not trying takeout. It didn't travel very well!",
            "Excellent!The owner came over to say hi and check on us, and I thought that that was very nice of her to do, and a classy move!The table bread they give is DELICIOUS. It's a soft, wheat-type bread and soooooo good. I couldn't eat enough.  :DI liked, and appreciated, how when one of us finished our food, the server left that empty plate until the other person was finished. I can't stand when servers whisk away an empty plate even if others at the table are eating! It's always a mark of a quality restaurant when the servers know to leave the empty plates until everyone is finished.Minus one star because of two different pasta dishes, both were a bit on the small side. Yummy, though....just a small portion of both. I'm there to fill my tummy!I will definitely go back....especially for that tasty soft wheat bread. SO GOOD.",
            "Ceasar: yawn. Tagliatelle: pretty great. Cioppini: average. Service: totally fine. So I'd give the food 3.5/4. The reason this review is 3 instead of 4, however, is to do with their facilities. One of their bathrooms were out of service. The wait was long and peopled were infuriated. Total buzzkill. For a crowded restaurant to only have one working restroom on a busy Friday night tells me the folks who run this place don't care much for their clients. Might not be true, but that's the message I received. Try harder, Pasta Moon.",
            "Consistent quality pasta, pizza and main courses. Pasta Moon is situated right in the heart of the main drag in Half Moon Bay. Their service is fantastic and their restaurant seems to keep growing to accommodate patrons.We had their classic lasagna, cioppino and pizza topped with salami, olive and red peppers. Everything was done very well. The seafood was fresh, the pizza was thin with the right amount of toppings, and lasagna was really good but I think mine is better.",
            "A-OK is exactly how I would describe this place. We came here and tried a variety of dishes, and while nothing was bad, nothing was worth writing home about. We had a pizza and pasta from the regular menu, as well as two of the daily specials- cioppino and a fish entree. My mom really liked the complimentary olive bread. Sparkling water comes with an extra charge, although our server did not tell us that before we ordered.",
            "This restaurant has the friendliest staff around. Not only that but also professional and helpful in making selections.  That sets the tone and  atmosphere for a really nice dining experience.The ambiance is cozy and comfortable and it feels like a well run family establishment, where all the staff seems to be a respected part of the family.We had a delightful meal starting with some crab cakes. Delicious with a nice aioli sauce. The accompanying bread was equally good with oil and vinegar for dipping.A seasonal salad was very good and satisfying, the ingredients fresh and well dressed.I went on to have the spare ribs! Yum...tender and drop off the bone with a fork.  The sides were also good although the green beans were a bit overcooked.We had an Italian white wine that was unique and quite good.I would definitely return to try some of the pasta dishes.",
            "Pasta Moon opened a little over 30 years ago, and I first visited 30 years ago when the restaurant occupied much smaller area than what they have now.  Today marks the 30th anniversary of my first visit on that rainy November day, and I have to admit, over the years Pasta Moon has gotten better and better.Owners Kim and Steve were on site to greet visitors and serve dishes just as they were 30 years ago. Ambiance- Dark and comfortable without being stuffy.  The place is typically packed with a blend of  locals and tourists  enjoying the their meals or hanging around the piano or bar, which gives it a lively fun feel.Tip - Make reservations, especially on weekends as it gets crowded.Service - Our waiter Dana was knowledgeable and pleasant and very eager to explain why each dish was \"fantastic\".  When asked if he had tried any of the Specials, he said he tried them all and the Risotto with white truffles was his favorite.  Even the assistant server Liz was very efficient and quietly filled our waters, brought extra bread, and informed us of the future move to a new location in 2019.  However, no freshly ground pepper was offered to us though I saw it for other tables.  Green Oak Creeks Farm Salad with Apples - This was a surprisingly well balanced and delectable dish.  The greens were fresh and not bitter, and the tangy dressing went well with the thin slivers of apple and bits or Pt. Reyes blue cheese.  Toasted almonds were substituted for the candies hazelnuts.  A delicious starter and for $15, with our only complaint being that we wanted more. 5 stars.Ribollita - A version of a vegetable soup reminiscent of a minestrone but with bread and kale and kohlrabi.  Nice that it was not too salty.  $12. 3 stars.Eggplant Parmesan - Nicely charred layers of eggplant that remained moist and not over cooked.  Mozzarella and Provolone blended well with the sweet tomatoes and garlic.  This was one of the best Eggplant Parms I've ever had.  5 stars.Grilled Pork Chop - I had seen someone else order this and had to ask Dana \"what is that\"? The chop itself was from Beeler farms and was huge, with a nice diamond pattern of grill marks.  The chop was perfectly cooked and was tender and juicy all the way through, with just a hint of smokiness.  The filling of pear, pancetta, and caramelized onions was subtle and additive.  The sides included mascarpone mashed potatoes and roasted/steamed Brussels sprouts.  Both were well done and the Brussels sprouts were a surprise because only the youngest spout halves were used and they were not over cooked nor bitter as you'll often find served in other places. 5 stars.Overall, Pasta Moon is getting 5 Stars hitting high marks on Ambiance, Service, and Food Quality.  When a restaurant has survived for 30 years, there's usually a reason.  Pasta Moon is still one of my favorites in the Half Moon Bay Area.",
            "Good flavors overall, but... Service was slow, dishes didn't come out of the kitchen at the same time and the room was half empty. Prices are OK for most of the mains, but the pasta was very overpriced for it's quality.Not over the moon good, but priced that way.If HMB had a lot of restaurants, I doubt they'd have had a 30 year run.",
            "Good spot to check out.......service was fast and food was good.  Bread that was served was very light and fresh.  Kind of a limited menu for pasta selections but the selections they offered was a good variety.Highly recommend for a casual Italian meal in HMB!",
            "Delicious pasta place in Half Moon Bay! I stopped by Pasta Moon with a few friends for an earlier dinner. The restaurant was pretty empty when we came in, but it filled up while we were there. It seems like they take reservations, so it might be a good idea to make a reservation. They brought free bread with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette which was delicious. We ordered the special appetizer which was bruschetta with burrata, which was pretty good. For my entree, I had pasta with Bolognese sauce, which was tasty, but a bit bland. I tried a bite of my friends tagliatelle with prosciutto, and that was really delicious. I would definitely recommend that over the bolognese if you try pasta moon. Service was fairly fast since there was nobody else around. We did have to ask for a dessert menu a few times, but it wasn't a big deal. The food came out quickly too. Overall, Pasta Moon is a solid place for a nice meal in Half Moon Bay!",
            "The worst food I've ever had at any restaurants but they charge very high prices. Their clam chowder was watery and uncooked. Pizza burned and tasted disgusting. Ravioli had no flavor, not even enough salt or pepper with no sauce. It was fried in some olive oil. That's it!  Their food tasted worse than any fast food restaurant!  I was about to throw up.  Well, they charged &70 for that disgusting food. When I complained to their manager, he not only did NOT apologize but also tried to make excuses such as : \"Our pizza over is 500 degree, of course it will burn!\"What?!!!  \"Our clam chowder is usually not thick\", etc. I did not stay to listen to the rest of his BS when I heard his responses and rude attitude. My stomach was hurting from their food and I just wanted to get out to use the restroom.Do not eat at this place, you'll regret it!",
            "We had a reservation and brought a cake which they kindly tucked away for us until after dinner.  We got a lovely table to celebrate a family milestone.  The food was wonderful, our server equally so and the owners checked in with us at the end of our meal. We enjoyed our Pasta Moon Experience and will be back!",
            "No, DO NOT come here. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. The food is not worth it and the drinks are terrible. Four stars? No. Not even close. Our server was in a hurry and I only interacted with him for 3 mins max in an hour. Didn't offer ANYTHING--once. He Just dropped off our plates and disappeared, never to be heard from again--Houdini did a better job. My experience was same with dessert, he dropped off the dessert card and disappeared. If you don't want good food and service and pay a lot for nothing, come here. If not, go elsewhere. I looked up and the waiters were having a meeting by the kitchen, sorry to be a bother. $75!!! What a complete let down",
            "Sadly we had a rough day at Pasta Moon.Very slow service did not bode well with DGD the Elder. We were there for close to two hours.We asked the waiter for gluten free bread, and 20 minutes later we had to ask again. They were baking it.Once Amazing Frito Misto was a complete fail.. over cooked and tough!Great gluten free pizza crust for DGD the Elder. Yummy pasta, lasagne, and salad.Still the best cheesecake ever... mascarpone elevated the flavor, texture was perfect ... In my opinion too many cheesecakes have lost any cake like texture, this reminded me that I love it!Some great, some not. Perhaps not a spot to take hungry children.",
            "Lovely lovely setting for casual dining! They were decorated very nicely for the holidays.  Servers were very attentive.  Cocktails were smaller and weaker though than we like it. Let's talk food. They are categorized as $$ or $30 and under. Yeah!  In their dreams!  Every menu item was priced under $30 but just in terms of a meal, I'd say they're $$$ per person.  Just saying!  $15 for a bowl of New England Clam Chowder that was thin in consistency but flavorful was just over the top not price-worthy!  Caesar Salad at $13 was at the edge too pricey.  Nicely presented though with 2 crostinis each topped with a little anchovy.  We shared a homemade sausage with mushrooms pizza.  Crust was very thin, light crisp... very delectable!  (Yeah, we thought the 9\" pizza was edgy pricey, too, at $22.). No, we're not cheap customers. We just know when items shouldn't cost as much UNNECESSARILY. While we give it a 3-star rating, we would still recommend Pasta Moon.  Id have given them a 3.5 stars. Being that Half Moon Bay is pretty secluded from the rest of the Bay Area food capital, you're paying for convenience and \"gourmet\".",
            "Prelim Review:Gnocchi was superb with great chew, umami savoriness, and creaminess from the sauce.Tagliatelle Bolognese delicious. (See pictures of both below).Service very kind and welcoming even to children.Large restaurant with warm, homey, spacious atmosphere.Strangely always a line for their two restroomsBar with the nightly sports game on.If the portions were bigger, prices were a bit lower, or if they had more avant garde ingredients/flavors, it would easily be 5-stars.",
            "Summary: an upscale restaurant with some crave-worthy items, friendly service, and multiple rooms with tons of tables.Details: I've been to Pasta Moon at least a half dozen times and have never been disappointed. I started to give it 4 stars and then realized I only had a few things to quibble about so landed on 5.One of my rules for dining out is to avoid the bread -- I don't want to fill up. BUT the bread here is worth it. Two kinds, hot out of the oven, with the oil and balsamic vinegar. Please take it away before I eat it all.The pizzas are legit. Our favorite is the house-made sausage with mushrooms. The \"soppressata\" with salami, red peppers, and olives is also quite tasty. Oddly, I didn't like the ricotta di bufala as much as I expected. The thin crust is authentically Italian. The gluten free version is one of the best we've had.The clam chowder has pancetta in it. 'Nuff said?The tagliatelle bolognese and the spaghetti puttanesca are really good but the entree to get is the lasagna. This might be the best lasagna I've eaten outside of Italy. Fair warning: it's a huge portion -- a half order would be plenty but I ordered the full and brought home leftovers. Next morning lasagna is even better than pizza.Pasta Moon is a big restaurant but you almost always need a reservation. It has a private dining room in the back and a banquet area. You can even eat in the bar. There aren't enough restrooms for the number of tables, especially when it's busy, so there can be a long line.The servers are all very friendly and you can find the owner Kim helping out on most nights.",
            "Hidden gem in half moon bay downtown. Delicious food, great fast service, spacious well lit ambience. A little pricy but totally worth it!We ordered:Mixed greens blue cheese apple salad - the blue cheese real worked in this salad to cut down the acidityButternut squash & Mascarpone ravioli - 4 stars on the sweet sidePappardelle Pancetta - 5 starsTagliatelle Bolognese - 5 stars Drinks and dessert (I want to try all the other desserts!)Strawberry nojito Tiramisu - 5 starsMeyer lemon parfait - this is the only thing I won't order again. A bit too tart and sour for my taste.",
            "I most recently came here to celebrate my birthday with some good friends. Although I have been here many times over the years, I have now learned to appreciate not just the good food here but the nice scenic and tranquil setting Pasta Moon is surrounded by.Located in downtown Half Moon Bay, there are many local shops come to browse through before or after you dine here. Parking can be challenging depending on when you come here. The drive using Highway 1 can be very beautiful or frustrating because of traffic, also depending on when you decide to come here. During my visit here last week, I decided to order the skirt steak with french fries and the steak was juicy and cooked perfectly to how I like my meat(medium well). Service has always been professional and friendly so no complaints here. They can be quite busy during the peak tourist season so with the Holidays coming soon, expect longer wait times. I highly suggest you make reservations before making the trip out here but it is definitely worth it.",
            "I love Pasta Moon. I worked there 30 years ago. The food is phenomenal, Kim is the nicest lady and the staff are excellent."

            "You don't come here for the food but that doesn't mean the food ain't good. It's definitely great after a long day out on the trails or drive through the California hills.Alice's is, and has been for a long time, the home of the motorcycle and car meet. Come here on a weekend or a holiday and you're bound to run into more than a handful of car clubs already parked up and hogging the tables inside. It's part of the charm of Alice's and I suppose it's maybe an issue if you're not much of a petrol head.On weekdays it's a hell of a lot quieter in the middle of the day. If you want to avoid waiting in line on a weekend you're going to have to get there at opening time when there will be tables but it'll still already have 20-30 folks seated inside.",
            "Alice's is one of those rare places that has a lock on a primo location; and with no serious, nearby competition.  And because they are the only game in town (if that town is upper Woodside) they consistently fill their seats on the weekends. If it's a nice day, parking will disappear early and there'll be a waiting list for breakfast, brunch and lunch.You'd think such a place would let the food quality slide, but it's actually still pretty decent. I've enjoyed their buffalo burger and the nachos are surprisingly well-executed. The beer list could be longer but they have a few good choices. I'd give the food & drink 3.5 stars max. My main issues here have been with aforementioned crowds and the service, the latter having slid downhill in the last few years. I've had my food delivered to the wrong table (with the error discovered too late), I've been served warm beers, and I've waited ten minutes for a beer, even when dining solo a mere 8 feet from the bar (and after having to remind the waitress).My other complaint is that they no longer will set aside space for larger groups.  It used to be we could reserve a spot for a group of 25 hungry and thirsty hikers here in the late afternoon, thereby avoiding the lunch and dinner rushes. But Alice's no longer wants to bother with that. I suppose they don't really need to, since they have plenty of business (and are probably raking it in). So we now drive down the hill to get our beer and burgers. Shame.On the positive side, Alice's is one of the better spots to people-watch on the weekends. Here you'll see daytrippers and tourists mixing with locals, road bikers, car club enthusiasts, hikers, and motorcycle groups. And anyone in those sets might include some retired, incognito silicon valley multi-millionaires (good luck trying to spot them).I used to enjoy frequent trips to Alice's, but with the crowds, the worsening service and the resistance to groups, my likelihood of returning here has diminished. Thus the rating downgrade.",
            "I've been following this restaurant since I was a kid living in England. The old Kawasaki motorcycle adds not only made me want to ride a bike but ride a bike to Alices like all the cool kids did. Many years later, the food risen to the same excellence as the experience itself. A must visit location for any culture or food experience lover.",
            "One of the best place i have ever been!!! The place is so pretty, location is magical! a restaurant at the middle on the woods, you can enjoy great food while enjoying a beautiful view! Staff are really good food was awesome all of their burgers are perfect most specially they have their own distinct flavor for the burger that you willNever taste in the other kind of burger. I love their past most specially their pasta carbonara!! I would definitely recommend this place!",
            "We've been meaning to go to Alice's for way too long, glad we finally took the time. Certain places in the Bay Area give you a taste of what life was like here in decades past; the fabric separating us from the hippie days is thinner, here. Nestled in the redwoods, Alice's was cozy, homey, offering a simple menu of fresh diner-type food to a '70s hits soundtrack. After a pleasantly twisty drive through the trees to get here, little is better than an endless cup of coffee and some Joni Mitchell to ease me into my morning.The food was fresh, mostly locally-sourced, and delicious. My wife really enjoyed the breakfast sausage, and I was pleasantly surprised by the biscuit (this is a function of being a southerner; I know full well \"biscuit\" can mean any damn thing outside of the South, but this one was good).Service was also fantastic... very attentive and I think we were helped by almost everyone (as other reviews indicate, seems to be a team effort). Even in a small place on a slow morning, it didn't feel like they were right on top of us, either, which was perfect. They always knew when my coffee needed to be topped up before I could ask, but I could still have a private conversation and not feel rushed or scrutinized.Tl;dr: Really cute, full of cool biker stuff and good vibes, fresh and tasty food, strong coffee. Redwood-surrounded. Recommended!",
            "My boyfriend has been wanting to take me to Alice's for the longest time since he's a huge car enthusiast and always comes here for breakfast/gather-ups before he and his friends go on drives. We came on a Saturday morning around 11, and got seated right away. The waiters and waitresses were very nice and attentive, and the food was decent, highly recommend the apple wood bacon, not too crispy with perfect amount of saltiness. The calamari is kind of towards the greasier side but the dipping sauce saved it. Overall, I wouldn't say the food is worth 4 stars because it's pretty standard, but if you like cars/bikes, this is definitely the place to be, it's like watching a live car show right in front you while you eat. Also the place has a very welcoming and diverse vibe. Would come back again and try the sandwich/burger options next time.",
            "Pretty unique stop for burgers at a family style restaurant that has a lot of history. The interior is like a large family home!The burgers here are pretty good, but my salad was kinda sad with just kale, dressing and seeds. I can't speak for the rest of the menu but I do appreciate that the ingredients are locally sourced.",
            "I've always heard people rave about Alice's being super amazing but all the times I've been here, I thought it was just okay. Nothing that will blow your socks off but they have some good staples.The item I always get is their garlic fries because they are always consistent with the quality. They are always super garlic-y, crispy, and hot. As for their burgers, I think it really needs seasoning. The quality is great but the last couple BMW burgers I had were bland. Drinks here are usually pretty good. Beer is always cold so thats good. Hot apple cider here is a bit on the watery side so that was whatevers.Service here is a hit or a miss. We usually sit outside so we get less attention than the people sitting inside but the last time I came, the waiters were having an argument with each other over some of them just chatting at the podium not working and how they need to help with dishes coming out. It was really awkward sitting there next to them arguing.I'm not in a hurry to come back to this place. I will drop by if i'm out in the mountains and I'm hungry but it's nothing special.",
            "Went here for my birthday brunch with a couple close friends. I had ordered the Ducati. Good was good, company was great and the view of our cars made it even sweeter.",
            "IF you get here early you'll love the place. IF you get here around lunch time you'll still love it but you'll most likely be waiting awhile for your food. The place gets insanely busy. All that being said it will always be a favorite stop over when riding in the area.",
            "After a windy drive through some secluded hills and woods, it's surprising to come to the intersection where Alice's is located. The woods suddenly open up, and there are tons of cars (and some very fancy ones!) and motorcycles parked here, even at 8:30am on a Sunday. Don't be deterred (we thought this meant a there was a huge wait at Alice's) - a lot of it is people parking their cars to go on bike rides, maybe some motorcycle meet-ups, and people going to the 2-3 other restaurants here. This really feels like a local favorite, and you're still surrounded by woods, so even though the food wasn't superb, it was still a nice experience!THE WAIT: Still, at 8:30am on a Sunday, it was busy here! We grabbed what we thought was the last table on the patio (we had our dog), only to later realize there was a also a back patio and probably more tables there. The restaurant was busy the whole time we were there, and around 11am there were maybe 10 people waiting. It's very family-friendly, and there's a whole grass field in the back where children and dogs can play. THE SERVICE: Fine, a bit hard to reach sometimes (my friend had to ask 3 different servers before she got her water) and we weren't quite sure who was officially our server, but we still had a nice time. THE FOOD:FROM THE GRIDDLE* Banana Bread French Toast ($11.25) - 3.5 starsThe toast itself was good, but it came out very plain. I wish it were dressed up with some whipped cream, fresh fruits, etc! * Belgian Waffle ($10.80) - 2 starsI didn't even try this because my friend said it wasn't worth it, she thought it was very dry.ALICE'S BREAKFAST SPECIALS* Ducati ($13.65) - I didn't try this but my friend really liked it and wolfed it down in minutes!* Redneck Benedict ($15.25) - 4 starsReally nice! Love having gravy for the sauce. However, the potatoes were dry and unexciting.",
            "Brunch here! Food is okay but the entire experience is amazing. Drive to this place is freaking awesome. If you have a bike even better, go on a ride or even better take someone on a ride/drive. You will see a ton of dudes in leather and bikes. Oh and some fancy cars as well. But def tons of bikes, sports bikes. Banana French toast is pretty delicious. We also got mimosas except the designated driver. Omelettes are delicious. They have a nice patio outside, would definitely recommend that than any other seating they have in this restaurant.",
            "Always pass by this place but had never really been in.  My friend wanted to hangout and I wanted to try something new.  So we got few friends together and headed out.  On the very front part of the menu, they gladly show all the locally sourced ingredients, from the Chicken, to the Lettuce.  From the beef to the drinks.  Instantly I'm already interested.  I love local and I love supporting small business.  Also stated that they only use NON GMO Rice oil for cooking!?  Wow standards are super high.You seat yourself from either outside or inside.  They had umbrellas to help with the sunlight.  I don't remember seeing heating stands for when it gets colder later.Lunch is served all day.  Their special dinner section only available after a certain time.  So we just got appetizers to start off with.  Jalapeno Poppers with cream cheese.  Sweet potato fries.  And my friend just ended getting the chicken wings appetizer as her meal.  I ordered their Grapefruit drink large (does not come with an refill) and it had to be the best fresh squeezed Grapefruit drink I've had.  I couldn't stop sipping it, I barely had quarter left of it to enjoy with my burger.  So yummy!ALL of them were delicious.  The ranch that came with the Jalapeno Poppers and wings were amazing.  And I normally don't like sweet potato fries but IT WAS AMAZING.Alices Specialty burgers are hard to decide on, they have a lot of options.  But you can substitute with Grass Fed Beef or Wagyu Beef which was four dollars more.  Asked to make it medium rare and cut in half.  All of it came out perfect.  Burger was so big that I took the other half home.  Place is a bit pricey BUT the ingredients and care into making food here is outstanding.  I look forward to coming back.",
            "There's a hippy-dippy vibe about this middle-of-nowhere diner that the owners recognize and publicize by taking advantage of the opening line of Arlo Guthrie's hippy-dippy 1967 opus...\"You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant\"...as their tagline. I don't know this area at all, so it felt like it took forever to get here from the Sand Hill Road exit off 280. It was just twenty minutes, but winding Hwy 84 seemed endless until I reached the fork in the road where Alice's appears under the towering redwoods amid a sea of motorcycles. No surprise that a huge front patio dominates the space.Since nobody said anything, I just sat at an open table for one right next to the waiter station. It was definitely happening here, and it was after 1:30PM in the middle of the week. The menu was mostly diner fare - big breakfast plates, burgers, sandwiches, and BBQ. I was trying to maneuver around the calorie minefield and decided to start with a reasonably satisfying $4.40 cup of Tomato Vegetable Soup that came with a packet of oyster crackers, the kind you expect with clam chowder (photo: bit.ly/2N31Wt3). Of course I ate 'em. This was followed by the $10.55 Kale Salad which I probably should have left well enough alone.Naked, it was tossed in a housemade avocado vinaigrette, Parmesan cheese, and toasted pine nuts. However, I had them add a grilled and sliced chicken breast which really didn't do much to enhance the flavor (photo: bit.ly/2Qns7IJ). In a more zen mood, I might have enjoyed my experience here more than I did. I just kept thinking this would be an ideal setting for a slasher-in-the-woods film, and of course, I'd be the first one to get offed right after the opening credits. My character would be \"Victim Who Missed His Diet Coke Refill\". By the way, leaving the restaurant, I drove north on Skyline Blvd., and I found that route a lot more pleasant until I got to 92 which was bumper to bumper.FOOD - 3 stars...nothing noteworthy though the kale itself was freshAMBIANCE - 4 stars...if you like the log cabin feel of a slasher film, you're in luckSERVICE - 3 stars...frankly a bit harriedTOTAL - 3 stars...you can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant...except sushi, haggis, and Hainan chickenRELATED - Looking for other dining options on the peninsula? Here's a collection of the places I've tried and reviewed: bit.ly/2KWj9yk",
            "A truly local gem with super tasty food!  Came here for breakfast for the first time before heading over to cut our own Christmas tree.  This restaurant is clearly a staple of the community and it's really heart warming to see the deep roots it has.  Seating was easy and there's both indoor and outdoor spots.  Service was friendly and fast.  We ended up splitting the banana bread french toast and the red neck benedict and both were super tasty.  The biscuit on the benedict was AMAZING.  I'd recommend splitting the French toast as I would have found it to be too much on it's own and it was great to alternate bites of sweet and savory between the two dishes.  Last bonus is if you love cool cars this is the perfect place to see them! Lots of car groups and clubs leverage Alice's as their go-to food spot so it's great car-watching if you're into that sort of thing.  I will definitely be back soon!",
            "New chef and menu for 2019 - dinner options are looking tasty! (See pic) All locally sourced.Lunch remains a great spot too - burgers and casual food, all locally sourced. Good spot for kids, order then the quinoa Mac and cheese and send them to play on the lawn while you sip a beer.Crazy busy on warm weekends, but empty on weekdays. Still worth the wait!",
            "A restaurant nestled amongst the woods.  It was a beautifully sunny weekday morning for brunch and found it to be a very popular place.  The restaurant is a place to go to before or after a long hike. I enjoyed eating my meal out on the patio. The potato Benedict was excellent.  I loved the sauce with the potatoes so that I didn't need to use ketchup.  The mixed greens were a compliment to the Benedict... and so leafy fresh.  Looking forward to my next hike in this area so I can dine again.",
            "Like the other few popular $$ restaurants in Woodside that I've tried, this one is just as meh as the last. What makes these types of restaurants popular? Is it the VCs? Is it the people with the fancy cars? Is it the VCs with the fancy cars? Life is full of mysteries.This place is kinda in the middle of no where. Parking is suboptimal. This place has lines. Quaint place. Luckily my group on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm was able to get a seat within 30 mins or so. Got the nice picnic benches on the hot sunny day, but luckily there are umbrellas.Mozzarella sticks 1/5 wasnt even melted when we first got it. I guess it must be still frozen or its not real cheese anyway.Calamari 3.5/5 decent and had tentacles which I like.Wagyu burger 2/5 This was the real disappointment. My burger was not even close to medium. It was well-done. The reason I did not want to bother asking for it redone for me was that literally everyone else's wagyu burger was also well-done. We all had chosen either medium or medium rare...if none of ours was correct...the redo was never going to be correct. The rest of the burger with cheese and fancy bibb lettuce arent gonna help the burger much.Side of chips was decent.Brisket sandwich 1/5 My not so smart friend got this along with his wagyu burger cause he was ultra hungry...but insta-regret when he saw what it was. Don't ever get bbq from a non-bbq place. This was basically a dry plain sandwich. Its smoked 12 hrs so that it can shrivel and die. He basically paid almost $40 for lunch by getting two burgers.Customer service is good. I'm going to hope the breakfast is better if I ever come back here again.",
            "The banana french toast is to die for. I'm still licking my lips as I think about it. I get the Ducati and switch up the toast for banana french toast, along with soft scrambled eggs and bacon. Yum!Alice's is one of my most favorite brunch places. The food is really good, and the drive up here has a great view too! Recommended!",
            "I went here with friends for senior ditch day, June 15, 2017 so around lunchtime, the restaurant had a couple of tables filled up but it wasn't that busy. The inside of the restaurant is a typical diner ambience(dark wood planks and a bar), but the outside is the nicest part of the restaurant-there's a nice patio with a spacious garden and a small field which leads to a pond. For appetizers, we got Buffalo Wings and fries-the wings were delicious, but I wish they would've came out hotter and the buffalo sauce wasn't that spicy. The fries had a good thickness, somewhat crispy on the oitside and soft on the inside, and seasoned well. For mains, I got The Hog Burger-everything on the held up well, he patties were cooked very well, and the the burger alone will definitely make you full. The kettle cooked chips that came with the burger had a very nice crisp, however they were unseasoned. The service was fast, but the waiters weren't that friendly-probably because we were a group of 9 and we might have been loud.Buffalo Wings and Fries - 4/5The Hog Burger - 4/5(burger 5/5; chips 2/5)Service - 2.5/5"

You can opt for inside or outside depending on the weather.My wife had the amazing French toast and I opted for the croissant breakfast sandwich with eggs, cheese and bacon! Wow!! All their baked goods are made in house and are awesome. I love their lemon poppyseed muffins. Generous portions, deliciously made, fresh natural ingredients and accompanied by great, friendly service...in our case that would be Alison. This is a wonderful spot to have brunch and lunch. We will be back to explore their many menu choices.Thanks again Alison for making us feel so at home!",
            "Food was good but service was terrible.Popped in here today with a buddy for breakfast and while our coffee order only took a few mins, breakfast order took 10, then 20 for food (missing toast with one), then 10 for the check. We couldn't find out several anywhere to expedite.But lattes were super good, breakfast was good and pastries on the way out we're as good as I remember.Would be great to tune up the bathroom situation but still workable.",

            "Whale City Bakery, Bar, and Grill is a very popular spot along the coast on the way to Santa Cruz on Highway 1.  Serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner as well as quick bakery items and coffee, Whale City is popular with both the tourists, cyclists, and locals that make their way to the area. During the lunch hour, it's a crowded stop, but luckily, numerous tables are open as the staff (probably wisely) make sure to seat people slowly as to not overwhelm the kitchen and some people are more in line for the bakery or the restroom.  The menu largely consists of diner-style fare with items consistent with its coastal location.   Our order:Basket of Beer Battered Onion Rings - $7.95. Freshly made and delicious with a crispy batter and very sweet onions. Reuben Sandwich - $13.50.  A nicely portioned sandwich with tender corned beef, nicely melted Swiss cheese, and a modest amount of sauerkraut.  Solid. Crab Cake Meal - $14.95.  Two smallish crab cakes were served with Hand cut French fries.  The French Fries were ok, likely double fried versus freshly made.  The crab cakes were similarly extra crispy with an interior largely of corn meal and disappointing crab content.  Definitely pass. Bowl of New England clam chowder - $7.95.  A bowl of lukewarm, fairly tepid chowder consisting largely of potatoes and tasting along the order of canned Progresso clam chowder.  The table liked the packaged oyster crackers though. Overall, Whale City is a solid stop along the coast that can have minimal choices.  The diner food may not be particularly memorable but both the pastries  and coffee get more solid reviews.  I did like my Reuben and onion rings though I'd definitely skip the crab cakes and chowder despite the coastal location.  Whale City accepts credit cards including Amex.",
            "We come here every time we go down to Davenport! Love it, such a cute place and great food, all across from the ocean. The outside tables are perfect for watching the sunset.",
            "Friends told boyfriend and I they always stop at Whale City Bakery Bar & Grill when they're going to Davenport beach. We parked across the street in the dirt lot and walked over.They have indoor and outdoor seating. At first we sat outdoors, but the table was a bit small for my preference and the sun was burning me alive, so we requested to be moved inside. The waiter was very nice and accommodating about it.Our drink and food order was taken immediately, but the food took a while to come out. I understand they're busy and fried foods take time, so we didn't mind. For a drink I got their Shirley Temple -- loved it! Refreshingly sweet and fruity. As for food, friends got their chicken tenders plate. As simple as it sounds, the tenders were delicious! Perfectly fried to where the outside was crispy and the inside was still tender. Their honey mustard sauce went great with it. Boyfriend got their fish and chips. I'm not a fan of fried fish so I always think the dish is so-so, but he quite enjoyed it.I was the only one who was disappointed in what they ordered. $15 for 2 of the smallest, most over-fried crab cakes I've ever had. Even the sauces couldn't redeem it. I didn't bother finishing even one of the crab cakes, so boyfriend helped out. I actually ended up helping my friends finish their chicken tenders -- again, so good!Service here was great. I kind of regret not getting something from their bakery, but hopefully next time. Although I didn't care for my meal, I'd still come back and either try something else or get those tenders.",
            "This restaurant is quite suitable for friends or family dinner. The service quality is perfect. Would come again when I drive on CA-SR1 next time",
            "Pretty decent burger and fries. Nice stop-off along highway 1. Usually have more to say but everything was super \"OK\" or I'm not fussy when it comes to burgers. But could not figure out why it's not a 5 star for me (pricey for what I ate maybe?). But that said, it's a perfect pit stop if you're going south before the crowds in Santa Cruz. Or what I often do, make the bakery the turn around point for a nice coast drive before heading back up north. Friendly service and outdoor seating if not too cold. Deadly crossing the road to the cliffs so not advised as not all slow down as they should.",
            "Omg AMAZING! We almost went to the place next to it but I trusted my fellow yelpers and the starts didn't let me down. Perfectly poached eggs, delicious pancakes (they let me get one regular and one blue berry) and what seasoning on the home fries . Service was also  . The fact that it's by the beach makes it feel more perfect. I try not to repeat places but this is a regular from now on every time we visit Santa Cruz. We arrived at 9 and beat the rush that quickly followed. We didn't have to wait for a table but others waited a little. So worth any wait though just writing this made me wish I was there again They have a bakery section which I will visit next time since breakfast filled me past the point of having any room for baked goods. What a true gem",
            "Whale City Bakery Bar & Grill was a nice spot for a relaxing brunch on a recent Saturday. We did have to wait a bit for a table but it was only about twenty minutes for our group of three.  We took our dog with us and she was welcomed. It is a small patio so keep that in mind if you're planning on bringing your pooch. Since it was before noon, we ordered breakfast dishes. My mother and I enjoyed our Mexican hot cocoa and chai. They serve local beer even before noon. I loved my huevos rancheros. The benedict and omelette that my family ordered were also tasty. Overall, a great spot for a delicious meal in Davenport.",
            "Just had some mediocre crab cakes here with fries so bad, they must've been on the bottom of the fry oil for hours. Asked the manager to comp the fries. He refused. Really?? Comping a customer for crap fries was harder than a bad review?",
            "Breakfast is great ! Everything else is really boring and limited ! They used to have these awesome steak fries they have the shittiest fries now, they don't have waffles or hash brows there's a bunch of local dudes that take up the whole bar and never any chicks there except the stuck up ones that work there . Meh",
            "Visited on our way back from seeing the elephant seals. We were cold and wanted some caffeine. We ordered chai lattes and sat near the windows. We will definitely be back and will try some of the food.",
            "The restaurant has a beautiful view of the ocean, a great location and the staff are friendly and wonderful .The food is fresh and excellent and the pie is well worth the try. I will visit this restaurant once again with its wonderful family friendly character",
            "Fantastic burgers! Burgers were very large and had a great flavor. Lots of toppings. Fries were a little over cooked, but good. Great selection of hot and cold non-alcoholic drinks, they even had Mexican hot chocolate organic sparkling apple juice! Happy we stopped here for lunch on our drive down to Monterey. It wouldn't have the same beautiful view of the ocean, but I'd love to see one in Columbus, OH!",
            "Visited Panther Beach and along the way a mile a way we stop by this place. Not bad on the price. Ordered fried catamari and bowl of clam chowder. 1st plate of Calamari was very small then they came back and gave us second plate due to the amount given to us.",
            "After a long hike to see the elephant seals at ano nuevo state park we found this fantastic place with great food .home baked treats and cold draught.  Super fun beachy vibe.great service with a cool staff. Definitely eat here!"

            "Nick's will forever be woven into the narrative of the fun day we spent in Montara Bay with our funny and interesting friend who works in a local Art Gallery and kept raving about his favorite Crab Sandwich at Nick's. Neither of us had ever tried a Crab Sandwich and honestly had no reference point for it. So, to Nick's in Pacifica we drove and ordered one each.We sat in the bar as there was a wait for dining room seating in the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday. Nick's parking lot is pretty much on the beach. The buildings here feel like they were built in the 70s or earlier and have not been updated. There's a classic charm in it. But, it's not like the Bay Area, where everything feels updated and manicured.Bar seating was around small tables with the sun shining brightly in off the ocean across the parking lot. Our crab sandwiches came fairly quickly and were delicious. Butter fried sour bread with a lightly seasoned crab salad filling, tomato and lettuce. It would be very easy to overstate the flavor of a salad like this. The purity of the crab flavor, unsauced, was reflective of the area to me. I'd expect such a sandwich in Texas to be \"enhanced\" with lots of seasoning or an aoli-like dressing. But this crab sandwich is unapologetically Dungeness in it's nature.I never asked for a menu and was surprised when the check came listing the $28 price tag. But, eh. It's Dungeness on the peninsula. And, it was a great memory.",
            "Three stars is basically a gift.  Service was very good. Food not so much.  Seems to be a favorite with locals and is right on a parking lot on the beach. Stopped for lunch on way to Half Moon Bay as they were still serving breakfast and the place was really busy.I started with a Siracha Bloody Mary which was ok and had a shrimp with the usual olive, celery, etc. but $13.Wife had chewy spongy pancakes, unscrambled scrimpBled eggs and bacon which was too hard to bite.  I had crab cake \"Benedict\" with not Bernaise but some kind of cheese sauce. Eggs were cooked just fine but crab was scarce for $20. We won't be back. Sorry",
            "Update 3/23/19: My dad gave me a giftcard here the other day so me and my wife swung by for dinner! I ordered the california burger and she ordered the crab sandwich that nicks is known for. We both got pickle fries with our sandwiches. I LOVE thier pickle fries, it was such a great addition to thier menu. I only wish they would give more like they used to, there where only like 5 of them on the plate and you have to spend an extra $2 on a already high price tag to get them. The california burger said it had sprouts on it which was also one reason i ordered that instead another option but they described it wrong.  It actually came with arugula. They do make the best burger in town however!I ordered my food to go and was also a little bothered by the waiter who checked me out. He implied i should leave a tip, but i usually never tip on a togo order i dont feel its necessary and thought it was very rude of him to ask.I dont come to nicks alot because of the high prices, maybe like 3 times a year, but every time i eat here i am pretty satisfied.",
            "In the area for a week, we made Nick's our \"expensive\" meal of the trip. But it really was quite reasonable, plus per the manager their lunch and dinner prices here are the same as are the portion sizes - which were beyond adequate. At $18 the smoked fish app was a great value that would be difficult if not impossible to find around where we live (Columbus Ohio). The pile of lox was delicate and mild. While a bit dry, the slab of peppered trout was flakey and nicely smoked. Sourdough toast points with whipped cream cheese plus capers, onions and Greek olives rounded out the selection. Definitely a keeper! Also wanted to try the crab so opted for a cocktail appetizer. A nice stack of shell-free meat in a chiller with a dollop of red sauce. $17 is a fair price, get it to share if you're not going to get crab as your dinner. Wife went with an omelette with cheddar cheese and bacon with onions. Very large omelette stuffed full, plus a slab of hash browns and sourdough toast on the side. Arrived 12:30 pm in a Monday, seated immediately and had drinks in hand quickly. Server was spot on throughout. Decor is pure beach town and fits the property's 92 year old personality well. Great view of Rockaway beach waves from their lot. Thumbs up all around.",
            "Boy oh boy now this is my type of restaurant! Me and my girlfriend came here on a super windy and rainy day, with big appetites and Nicks did not disappoint.We were quickly seated and got lucky we beat the dinner rush. We had a beautiful view of the ocean from where we sat. The ambiance inside is super nice. They had a bar area on the other side of the restaurant which would be nice to watch a game and relax if you like. Now let's get to the food.We ordered a burger and the crab sandwich. Both were HUGE. We did the boyfriend girlfriend thing where we split them both and got half each. The burger was super juicy, and came with plenty of fries. The crab sandwich was phenomenal! It was huge and very tasty. I'm not the biggest fan of crab, but this was by far the best crab sandwich I've ever had. It comes on sourdough bread and is super tasty with every bite you take! I'm getting hungry just talking about it. Nicks did not disappoint and I will for sure be back!",
            "Popped in for lunch and ended up ordering the fish and chips, the crab sandwich and  a cup of clam chowder to try, Since I am a clam chowder snob. All our dishes were large portions I was very surprised at the fish and chips size. The clam chowder was exceptional has to be one of the best I've had between San Francisco and Half moon bay.  My husband states that the crab sandwich with large a little bit on the bland side and overpriced.",
            "Nick's is a classic Pacifica restaurant right next to Rockaway Beach.  My boyfriend and I ate here on our weekend trip to Pacifica.  Nick's was right across the street from our hotel so we decided to try it out.We loved everything we ordered.  We started with the fried calamari appetizers.  The calamari was probably the best part of the meal for both of us.  For our main entries, I ordered the fish special which was grilled halibut over a corn puree of some sort.  My boyfriend ordered the classic fish and chips.  And for dessert, we ordered the mudd pie, which is a chocolate/fudge cake of some sort.  We really enjoyed everything we tried.  My halibut was perfectly grilled and my boyfriend's fish and chips was fried perfectly.  The mudd pie we had, which was recommended by our waiter, was delicious as well.  We left the restaurant very full and very satisfied!  The restaurant is pretty noisy.  It was very crowded with all tables full.  We waited around 30 minutes for a table on a Friday night around 7pm.  Our waiter provided really quick service.  He always came back to check on us and gave us great recommendations on which desserts to try.  This restaurant is pricey, but that is to be expected since it is a seafood restaurant.   It is very easy to rack up an $100+ bill here with appetizers, entries, desserts, and drinks.   However it is a must try for any seafood lover!  Nick's also makes a great date night spot!  It is our new favorite in town and we will back!",
            "Two stars for the view. Hostess somewhat rude. Delighted in telling us that there was a 60-90 minutes wait, despite the fact that there were at least three tables that were empty. We ended up eating across the street, a delightful meal with excellent service. We will not go back to Nick's.",
            "Awesome meal and an even better view...:)  We have been to Nick's a few times now and we have always enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere...A must see when in Pacifica.",
            "5 stars for the famous nick crab sandwich. It's $25 bucks for this sandwich and a side of fries but so worth it. Everything else here that I've had is delicious the crab sandwich is just my favorite.  I recommend taking a nice walk from Linda mar beach over the hill to Rockaway beach where the view is breath taking. Order a crab sandwich eat along the water front or on the hill (there are seats) and then take and nice walk back. In my opinion way better than any other crab sandwich I've had lol I'll no longer be getting crab sandwiches at the giants at&t ball park.",
            "My sis and I stopped here after accidentally hiking over two cliffside coastal trails a few miles north. A friend had previously recommended this spot when I told her we would be visiting her town over the holidays, and Nick's is the most obvious building you can find closest to the ocean. It features a metal fence in front of bay windows where passerby can get inadvertently or (advertently) destroyed by violently crashing waves, much to the delight of the clientele inside watching and waiting. There was plenty of parking, and access to other beachside restaurants and tourist shops. We sat at the bar and only sampled the plain french fries (garlic fries were served after lunch hours), and bloody marys sans the shrimp adornment per our non-seafood diet. A sign behind the bar sternly reminded us that we would need to wear collared shirts during dancing hours, so keep that in mind when they host live music. This spot had a little divey feel, complete with ample mirrors, dark lighting, dark carpets, and lots of booth seating. I particularly enjoyed the sandblasted glass dividing the bar area from the dining area with an assortment of nervous looking sea creatures etched along it. Overall, cute for a drink, well priced at happy hour, presumably good for seafood, and arguably the best view you could ask for. Stumble upon it for yourself.",
            "This restaurant is a Pacifica institution and coming here for dinner is like traveling to the 50s and 60s. There's a lounge area where they have live music, a dance floor and serve appetizers and drinks while you wait for your table.  The menu in the dining room is classic American (surf, turf, salads and burgers).  I had the lamb chop appetizer in the lounge area and the fettuccine shell feast in the dining room.  They also brought out garlic bread for the table.  I think the food itself is very mediocre - the lamb chops and the seafood were OK. The pasta was al dente but the sauce was a bit soupy (I expected it to be creamier).  The garlic bread could have been toastier.  The portion sizes were HUGE and my vegetarian friends loved that this place serves the Impossible burger (fake meat that looks and tastes like the real deal, kinda).Service was spotty since this place gets busy. Including tax and tip, the meal was about $50-$60 per person.  I really, really love the ambiance here and the location right next to the ocean.",
            "You can never go wrong at Nick's for breakfast- they keep it simple and consistent. The waffle here is good! Ordered the crab sandwich for lunch with avocado and Swiss cheese -  wow!! The portion was huge and I could only eat half of it - very good sandwich and would definitely recommend it and reorder it. I will continue to come here for breakfast and crab sandwich.",
            "I'm not a review person but I want to let this 1 out there. I really wanted to like this place and I did for the first few minutes of being there. I've got family that are locals and have been coming here for YEARS so I was pretty stoked to check it out. The food was good, but the service from 1 particular older male really killed my appetite. My soon to be 2 yr old was a bit cranky since he'd woken up from a short nap, so I popped some Netflix on my phone so that he could watch his movie Cars and he was good. But this older male server came and asked me \"That is really annoying, isn't it?\" I was confused about what he was referring to so he asked me again a 2ND time. I then replied, \"oh, you mean my phone?\" He then replies yes but I responded with \"no, because I love Cars too\". He replied to me with \"Well, as long as it isn't bothering these guys, or these guys.\" Mind you, there was no one paying any mind to my son at all and I'm always aware if someone was or not so I could have him tone it down. That was HELLA rude of him and it actually pissed me off to the point that I didn't want to finish my food. Ironic because soon as my mood changed, so did my son's. He then kept telling me he wanted to go outside, so I ended up leaving my mom in the restaurant SMH. Crazy how a child can sense something's just not right. This was supposed to be a nice lunch with my mom and baby boy.I really wanted to like this place and thought I should bring my man here, but no thanks bro. That 1 server should've kept his thoughts to himself and just do his job, but he had to ruin it with his ignorance and salty words.",
            "For our last night in the Bay Area this trip, we discussed going out for live music and dancing with my brother and sister-in-law.  My bro did some research, and my SIL recommended considering Nick's.  They've been before and liked the large dance floor, and thought we'd like it, since we like to ballroom dance.Though it was a bit of a drive on a foggy, drizzly evening, it was a great choice. The venue has an old school feel, for sure.  The lounge area is good sized, adjacent to a large bar.  The dance floor is linoleum, with enough space for those who enjoy swing, cha cha, and rumba to do their thing.I didn't have my dance shoes with me, so I can't comment on whether the floor was comfortable to dance on.  I made do with my boots, due to the weather. It was fun to watch the couples that were there to groove with the band.  The house band was playing, with Stephanie Teel, a local San Francisco-based singer-songwriter, taking lead vocals and playing guitar.  The numbers ranged from 60's through contemporary time.  I liked the variety.We were systematically ignored by the waitress working the lounge, which was odd.  We waited so long to be served that Dear Hubby was heading for the bar to order that way.  He ran into a waiter, who then immediately came over and took good care of our table the rest of the evening. We had a fun time until last call came along. The website for the restaurant says live music on weekends until Midnight, but they stopped at 11 p.m.  I was grateful that they were able to make a virgin blended drink for me, which was topically delicious.  All in all, worth the drive to Pacifica, by the crashing Pacific.",
            "This restaurant is like a place out of a 70s mob movie. In fact, if old Italian men were smoking cigars in the lounge, it would have added some ambiance. This restaurant is a waste of prime real estate and needs a complete overhaul. We ordered a Caesar salad and burger. The salad had way too much dressing, but the flavor was good. The $17 burger was good, but not really a $17 burger. The rest of the items seemed way overpriced for the setting. Needless to say, we won't be back. Don't waste your money, you'd be better off at Round Table.",
            "We were here after a nice day in Pacifica. Great way to watch the sunset and eat a great meal. Our server was awesome (unfortunately forgot his name) and suggested we try the crab sandwich. We decided to go with the calamari as well. The sandwich was stuffed with tons of meat and came with a side of fries. I would recommend this here! The calamari was a little too greasy or my liking, as I like mine crispier. It was tasty none the less. Perfect views of the sunset for a date!",
            "I am always surprised that people give this place such good reviews and say how much they like it. I have gone back several times thinking I must have \"just had a bad experience\", well, that will now end. Not going back again. The food is over priced for what it is. It tends to be bland and the seafood is far, far better with a short trip to Half Moon Bay or even just across the street at Moonraker. I have yet to have even mediocre service here, it is just terrible. Both for breakfast and dinner. I usually get a seat with a torn cushion, so that is always fun. I don't get it. It's old, run down, bland, overpriced food with bad service. Glad others like it, but not for me.",
            "Second time here and we got the same waiter: she's the best. We also met some locals and they were friendly. Fish and chips were the best I had. They were huge and it had way more fish then breading. I never had that much fish ever.The crab sandwich with onion rings were yummy and a must get.Spicy Bloody Mary w/shrimp is great.",
            "Impressive.  4 of us at lunch.  Ordered - Grill crab salad sandwich (4).  Rating 4/5     open face green salad     open face avocado onion rings     sandwich with avocado, fried pickles     sandwich with avocado, onion rings- clam chowder. Rating:  4/5 - Oyster Rockefeller Rating:  4/5. (Awesome)Waiters friendly and personal. Excellent service.   Beautiful view looking out to the ocean.Will definitely return to try other items in the menu."

            "Wonderful!We arrived a bit early for our reservation and enjoyed a drink on the outside patio and was alerted via a pager when our table was ready.The view on the patio and from our table was just exquisite! Watching the sunset after a long day was the perfect remedy to a long wonderful weekend and a perfect set up for the coming busy work week.The food was really good! The oysters were creamy and huge and really delicious! No shells or grit, perfectly shucked!The filet mignon was perfectly cooked rare and a of great quality!The staff was friendly and the service was great!Our server was sweet and attentive and we never felt rushed or unwanted! Great service all around!The restaurant has so much history and they provide you with a print out which I took with me, I won't spoil it but its just really cool! Definitely worth the trip for a date night or special occasion!",
            "Rainy March Sat made a reservation for 4:45pm, was off season and not crowded.  The small bar area had 2 tv with basketball game on.  The porch outside had a gas fire pit with lava rocks.  We arrived 15min early, but seated immediately.  They have a children's menu and crayons to draw on the paper table cover, was a good touch for families.  The small bowl of clam chowder was thick and tasty, great for the rainy weather, some grittiness on the bottom, but was fine.  The large kale and quinoa salad was enough to share with 4 people or take home.  The pulled pork tacos were just ok, a bit too much shredded lettuce.  The sour dough bread rolls were fresh and chewy was perfect match for soup and salad.     The kids meal 2 mini burgers were the same as the devil's sliders without the extra  aioli, bacon, mushroom, and onion option.  Upgraded to the sweet potato fries were crispy and plentiful for leftovers or sharing.     Dessert was the $10 chocolate fudge cake with whipped cream was not baked same day fresh had a dry refrigerated texture, but our kid loved it.     Agreed the food is just ok and pricey, but the view and friendly service, we would come again on another winter off season.",
            "Oh how I love this place!  The BEST seafood quesadilla ever!   And according to my husband the pulled pork rancheros were amazing.  Sunday Brunch is our favorite.  We love that it's a laid back place with great food.  Endless mimosas on Sunday!Get there early and request a window seat.  Nothing like sitting on the edge of the Pacific Ocean while having brunch!",
            "I've been coming to HMB my whole life and this hidden restaurant was introduced to me only just a few years ago and it's become a stopping point ever since. If you want to do it right, sit out the back where they have firepits overlooking the ocean. Order a couple bloody mary's, their delicious fish and chips and beer battered artichoke hearts. You will not be disappointed.",
            "A little bit of a drive down the coast, but well worth it for the food, drinks, view, and fire pits!Great service, kind staff, family friendly, and the view is the best!",
            "great views, seating options, appetizers and service. They are kid friendly as well.  After your meal the kids can \"spin the wheel\" and get a prize! Sunsets next to the fire with a glass of wine is magic. Bring your dog too, there is even a dog menu!",
            "Food was delicious. Views were beautiful and staff was very nice and helpful. I had the Coquille De Mer where as my wife had the Seafood Platter and Caeser salad. We both samples each other's. It was all delicious. I recommend",
            "Moss Beach Distillery is on most tourist itineraries, with good reason. The magnificent cliff side location, the legend of the Blue Lady's ghost (with occasional \"sightings\"), the swirling ocean mists, and proximity to both San Francisco and Silicon Valley make it a no-brainer destination for anyone visiting the Bay area. But here's a tip from someone who has been there a couple of times - come for the legend and the view, not the food. Let me start with what I like about the place: Atmosphere. There is not a bad seat in the house, you get lovely ocean views from indoor tables as well as the outdoor patio, plus everyone seems happy to be there.The service can be hit or miss. This last weekend when my wife and I stopped by, it was unfortunately the latter. Our server messed up our orders a couple of times, didn't bring us any bread rolls, and our table was void of any condiments. She didn't bring any even when we told her our food was dry and we could use some sauce, she just apologized. There is nothing hit or miss about the food, however; it is consistently mediocre. And overpriced. We ordered a calamari appetizer (too dry and flaky), Devil's sliders (all three beef slider variations were too dry, though the side of fries was decent), Coast sliders (the tuna and salmon sliders were meh, the crab cake slider slightly above par), and bread pudding for dessert (we finished the ice cream, but only about a  third of the tasteless bread pudding). My favorite dish was the steamed vegetable side that I asked our server to substitute my fries with. I enjoyed this - it was full of asparagus, artichoke and other fresh vegetables. Later I found out this \"substitution\" set us back a hefty $8.75 (our server neglected to inform us there was an extra charge).  After our meal, my wife and I went for a stroll along the cliff edge, delighting in the unusual vegetation and almost horizontal cypress trees, watching lines of pelicans skim the ocean surface looking for their next meal, and seeing the fog roll in. I heart you, Moss Beach Distillery. You're perfect in so many ways. But please do something about your food - otherwise we will stop by next time just for the legend and the view, not the food.",
            "This review is for take-out only.My family rented out the Airbnb a few feet away from The Distillery and based on its high praising reviews, we had to try it! Three of us decided to order take-away-- the inside was packed! The bartender, Joseph D., placed our order and was super chill. After a 25 minute wait and $80.48 (excluding the $10.00 cash tip) later, we left with four food items: Dos Fish Tacos ($17.50), Cup of Clam Chowder ($9.00), Fettuccine Alfredo with Prawns ($31.75), and a Burger ($15.75). Needless to say, the food was underwhelming and just \"meh\", which was disappointing because it wasn't a cheap meal. The tacos were mediocre, the clam chowder was extremely gritty with every bite, and the medium rare burger was cooked almost well done. However, my 16 year old brother enjoyed his fettuccine alfredo. Food always tastes better when you're not the one paying for it. ;)  Two stars for the convenient location and bartender, but I won't return based on the price point and sub-par food.",
            "Not worth the price. Overall 2.5. I was happy to have a dog friendly patio, but there was no service outside. I saw a waitress 3 times during our visit. Once for water and the other times was to bring out drinks.We did have to retrieve our own food and put our plates away, which is fine, but when paying $47 bucks for mediocre food... no thanks!The presentation of all the dishes was terrible. The Louie salad was sad. Seriously could've made this at home. Full lettuce leaves, cucumber, tomatoes were slightly sad, avocado, egg and prawns with dressing. That was it. $23The sweet potato fries were $9.. they were okay.And the shrimp cocktail. $15No drinks...I would probably come here for a lite appetizer and drinks next time, but not a meal. I'm sure the experience is different inside, but I don't like the feeling of being neglected when I'm paying for a service.",
            "The restaurant has a gorgeous view of the bay. The staff is very nice and friendly. This place makes for a perfect choice for a seafood brunch. They have a wide variety of options to offer in their 40$ brunch per person. The restaurant has the flexibility to make a vegetarian breakfast if that is what you prefer. The eggs benedict is served with home fries. Bottomless mimosa, breakfast with pastries, and fruits is a good deal for 40 bucks.",
            "Excellent patio that dangles 100ft high over the Pacific Ocean between Half Moon and Pacifica. One of our favorite stops on the way back from the beach. There's usually seating in the patio area and several cozy fire pits. The dining room feels a bit stuffy but the views are near-perfect as well.Simple beer selection but they make up with a large cocktail selection. Best snacks to order outside: fried artichokes, crab cakes, garlic fries (not on menu).",
            "WOW Can we just talk about the clam chowder here? Like it's delicious. Way better than San chowder house lol. The consistency and meat they give you!!! Legit.Let's talk about the patio though, need more heat lamps. First time ever gettin complimentary blankets cus it's so cold lol. Not enough tables, not really comfortable.  Food is a little overpriced in my opinion.... my garlic fries were $10 lol like WHAT? They were good but whatsup with the upcharge. I get it- but still. The burger was priced at $15 how are you gonna charge $10 for fries lol.Anyways, rating is solely on the clam chowder.Experience is about a 3.Still recommend! Maybe on a hotter day.",
            "We had been eating all weekend so ordered salads. The service was great.Drinks were yummy and the food perfect.",
            "I recently had lunch here with two friends, and it was lovely. The view of the ocean, the historic restaurant, the food, and service were all excellent. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have a full bar, nice choice of beers and wines too. The food was remarkably good. One tip, if you have a dog, you can bring them to the back patio, just look for the separate dog entrance (so you aren't taking your pooch through the restaurant). I'd like to dine here at night and see what the night feels like at this windy, sweet spot.",
            "Come for the view...stay for the food. We had an excellent 3 course meal tonight with clam chowder, devils sliders and mud pie for desert. The staff is excellent and very attentive, that's why we make the 3 hour drive to come here.",
            "What an amazing place!! We 'discovered' this place by sheer luck on a gloriously sunny Friday afternoon after a beach walk with our dog. Wow. A gem of a place. Absolutely LOVE it!! Sat on the dog friendly patio soaking up the winter afternoon sun. The menu had something for everyone including GF options!! Fish tacos, burger, fish n chips. Lagunitas on tap. Perfect.The self serve ordering worked fine. Got some help from the friendly bar tender. Food was good. It was an absolute perfect afternoon. We will be back!!",
            "One of my good girlfriends lives around Half Moon Bay. Since she couldn't get together until a little later, a friend and I decided to check out Moss Beach Distillery first. We stopped by on Friday, June 22nd around 6:15pm. She joined us about an hour later.*Oyster on the half shell: single freshly shucked oyster served with horseradish & cocktail sauce ($2 each) x12*Buttermilk onion rings: with savory pineapple-molasses bbq sauce ($6)*Un fish taco: fresh cod buttermilk battered and fried, dusted with Creole seasoning and topped with spicy lime aioli and cabbage, Tucked into a corn tortilla with fresh pico de gallo on the side ($8)*Pulled pork nachos: homemade tortilla chips topped with slow cooked pulled pork, tomatillo sauce, cheese, sour cream and pico de gallo ($8)*Coastside crab cake: pan seared crab cake served atop a jicama-cucumber salad with a bay spice aioli and a drizzle of chimichurri ($10)*Prohibition Mai Tai: Coconut rum, white rum, pineapple juice, orange juice and grenadine served with a floater of dark rum served in a pint glass ($6)*Cadillac Margarita: Tequila, triple sec, sweet & sour, fresh lime juice, splash of orange juice and a floater of Grand Marnier served in a pint glass ($6)*House Cabernet ($4.75) x2*Guinness Stout ($3.50)Their happy hour is Monday through Friday, 5pm - 7pm in the bar and patio only. Since I wanted to sit outside, this worked for us. Their specials include HH food and 50% off well drinks, house chardonnay and cabernet, all beer, featured specialty cocktails. I accidentally ordered a specific cab instead of the house, so I ended up with the Hess Cabernet, Napa Valley - Ca ($11.50) x2. Otherwise, everything we ordered was a HH special.We started with the two cocktails. I got the mai tai which was rather weak for me. Felt the same way about the margarita, so I'd stay away from the cocktails unless you want something a light and sweet. Since my gf is a wine drinker, I just moved on to wine. I can't recall what the house cab was, but it was fine. A drinkable table red. The hess I ordered was definitely better. Food wise, I liked the nachos. Good amount of pulled pork. The fish taco was also fried nicely, but even at the HH price of $8, I thought it was a little pricey for what it was. For the oysters, if you are not a fan of larger oysters, I wouldn't order these. I'm honestly a fan of smaller oysters as I find they have a crisper, cleaner taste. These were definitely meaty. Almost like barbecue oysters. Glad I only got a dozen as I don't think I could have had more than that. The crab cake and onion rings were fine. Though I prefer a crunchier batter. This batter was fluffy and airy.I love sitting outside on a nice day as I rarely get to do that in San Francisco. It was a little chilly and windy, but still great with the ocean view. Most of the tables were filled up when we arrived, so we started at a bench off to the side. When a table up front opened up, we moved over there. Just big enough for our party of three. I also sat by the fire for a little when a bench opened up later. Really pretty with the setting sun.Nice place to enjoy the ocean view while having a couple HH wines and beers. I don't think the pricing on their HH food is that great, but a few snacks while drinking won't break the pocketbook. Overall, an A-OK spot!",
            "Great food..great drinks.. every single time! We had a wonderful brunch this last visit. Matteo our server was phenomenal (seriously top notch and sweet to boot)!! Thank you and cheers to Moss Beach Distillery",
            "I've been here before but this was the first stop for lunch on our PCH1 trip. It didn't open until 12 and we were early so we went to the beach below. Once open we had beverages and had the burger and fish tacos. I split my meal with my girlfriend and although her fish tacos were light and yummy... my burger was YUMMY! Garlic fries did not disappoint. The view from the outside patio is beautiful. I prefer sitting at the bar where you can get service quickly. The oyster shooters were also very good...."

            "What an excellent find, entering downtown HMB for the first time!  It was an odd hour at 2ish to be seeking ailment.  Sacrilege popped up on my Yelp radar and looked most enticing.It's an \"order-at-the-counter-seat-yourself\" deal with a number and getting the food delivered by a super friendly team member.  The beer list has something for everyone: stouts, ciders, IPA's etc.  Wine is available also.  They offer a basic variety of American fare some more healthier than others.  We were up for some bites.  Artichoke hearts were a new one for us, and Sacrilege hit the spot with these delectable, lightly breaded gems.  The outer portion complimented the tastiness of the hearts inside.  The grass-fed chili was as amazing as it looks.  Fries were thin and good also - just wasn't hot on the mayonnaise dip. The sriracha cream cheese dip that came with the hearts was better but kind of heavy for my taste. I would come through here again for another hearty cup of chili, some brew and to try more bites.  The atmosphere is quite jovial and full of vibrancy - one worthy of future visits!",
            "Half Moon Bay is such a happy hamlet that finding excuses for excursions here don't require that much incentive for me. Usually a walk along one of the oceanfront trails followed by a light lunch would do me just fine for a weekend respite. Finding a scenic trail is not the difficult part, but a good lunch can become a hit-or-miss affair if you have my Yelp-driven tendency to try something different each time you visit these parts. That's what led me to Sacrilege. Not a purportedly vile act of secularism but a brewpub on Main Street.This was most definitely a brewpub because most of the focus was on the beer - at least fifteen on tap, four of which are brewed in-house, and a seemingly endless variety in cans. Food took a back seat, and frankly it may even be in the trunk. The one staff person taking the orders in front couldn't speak to the food with much clarity when I asked about ingredients in the dishes offered. However, it wouldn't be for lack of effort in the kitchen. They need to keep refining it and explain what they did to the rest of the staff. Take for example, the $8 bowl of their Cali Clam Chowder.It was an admirable cream-free, tomato-free concoction that used fish stock instead but somehow fell short on flavor, appearance, and satisfaction. A plus was the toasted wedges of French bread for easy dipping (photo: bit.ly/2GZ6tIJ). I also tried a daily special, the $16 Caprese Salad with Chicken which was an odd presentation of an old standby as it looked like a toppled Napoleon with the tomatoes decidedly unripened and the grilled chicken breast somewhat overpowering the rest (photo: bit.ly/2GZK26i). Guess I'll come back for the beer if there is a next time.FOOD - 3 stars...nice try but execution still needed workAMBIANCE - 3 stars...yep, it's a brewpub...in a houseSERVICE - 2.5 stars...more staff training may be neededTOTAL - 3 stars...I'll probably just keep walking down Main Street.RELATED - Looking for dining options on the peninsula? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed: bit.ly/2KWj9yk",
            "While visiting two friends down in the Bay area, we made our way to Half Moon Bay for the afternoon. They brought me to Sacrilege Brewery + Kitchen and it did not disappoint. They have a nice variety of both indoor and outdoor seating, high tops and classic tables. They also had some couches and chairs for a more relaxed vibe. The TVs all had the college playoff football matches on, which I enjoyed watching as we sipped our beers and caught up.Besides a nice variety of beers (they even had a sour that I loved), we munched on some pretzels with beer cheese (yum!) and some french fries. The pretzels with beer cheese were absolutely delicious and we could have easily devoured another order or two more of those. The fries were fries. Nothing special there.I really enjoyed the atmosphere on this place and the fact that they carry such a wide variety of beers on tap; everything from stouts and IPAs, to blondes and sours. My new favorite brewery to visit in the Half Moon Bay area.",
            "Well from a Vegan point of view, they do have  options. But experience here was mediocre. Got pretzel bites without butter. They were over cooked and hard to bite. Salad was lettuce and a couple of tomatoes. No cucumber as promised. They have 3 kombucha flavors. They have a house made overly fried Vegan burger with Vegan buns. Was yearning for beyond meat or impossible burger. They forgot my pickle and forgot side of pesto for my GF. Fries were stringy and mostly burnt. She like concept of garlipeno - garlic and jallenpeno fries. Will be looking for a more vegan-friendly, less burned food faire next time I visit.  #vegan",
            "This place is an adorable little gem.  On a cold night this is a safe haven of beer, food, and warmth. If you happen to be in the area it's absolutely worth coming to. On a Saturday night around 6pm we had no problem finding a spot for 4 and there seemed to be plenty of seating available the whole time we were there.  And although it's street parking only, it's not crowded and we had no problem finding a spot!I recommend trying any of their home brews - originals are super good! We had the fries and nachos to go with our beer.  Great sidekicks to a cold glass of beer!  Fries are skinny and a generous portion.Overall I think what makes this place really special are the people and the ambiance.  They light candles around the restaurant when it gets dark out and it helps make everything feel homey.  It's just a super cute vibe and you'll know what I mean if you go!",
            "I love this place even more now that they are offering gluten free buns! The food is excellent and even though I can always eat a burger with a knife and fork, sometimes it's just nice to be able to eat a burger like a burger. We also love the live music when they have it - what a refreshing addition to living on the coast!",
            "This place is cute! It looks like a house and there's seating on the porch/front yard. The pricing is actually incorrect on some photos. Some photos display higher pricing than what we saw but maybe they found it was too expensive?  At first we were going to skip out because it seemed too expensive, but is actually well priced. So I'm not a beer drinker but there are 6 wines all priced at $10. Heavy pours and excellent quality! Picket fence Chardonnay and Meomi Pinot Noir were two of my favs.  They have Sofia rose in a can. All poured in heavy duty stemless wine glasses. So worth $10. Plenty of beers where the husband got the Waketume for ~$7.We also ordered a basket of fries ($5) plus the garlepeno topping (fresh chopped garlic and jalapeños). Served with their house aioli (yum). They ran out of pierogis  this week which were 3 for $5 or 6 for $9.  Next time.We also ordered pretzel bites with their house mustard. All of it was delicious.  We opted to sit at their \"bar seating area\", which is really just for seating and not serving beverages.  There are also regular seats and communal tables available. Several TVs as well. You order at the front and find your seat. They'll bring you the food. You take your drinks with you. There are plenty of other food options too, but we were super content with our \"Saturday happy hour\" find.",
            "Great spot. The IPA was excellent and the chicken in the chicken BBQ sandwich and the Cobb salad was perfectly cooked. The shoestring fries were also tasty. Overall, a great meal, beer and a very friendly staff.",
            "We checked out this place based on a recommendation. We enjoyed a local  hazy and a strawberry cider. Service was great and knowledgeable. The view: the server behind the counter had pretty blue eyes! We will return to try their food!",
            "Delicious! Spontaneous visit to Half Moon Bay at lunch time with my husband. Grilled salmon tacos are among the best I've had and paired well with their Pilsner. My husbands Bare Bottle breakfast stout went perfectly with the huevas rancheros.",
            "Great addition (yeah, I know I'm late to the party) to HMB casual food and drink scene. Some good home brews on tap along with interesting guest brews. Pretty hearty pub fare with some unusual options--burrata poutine is an example. We lucked into their \"Best Fridays\" all day happy hour deal. $5 own beers and selection of $5 bar bites is only HH deal in town. Gets super festive by 6 on Fridays. Great place to watch a game with friends or warm up after beach!",
            "At first the atmosphere seemed too casual for our work group but I tried all of Sacrilage's beers via a taster and one ale that I enjoyed. I got a generous portion of ribs. My coworker got the 3 tacos and it wasn't quite enough for a full meal. For a hang-out spot, this is would be great though. Good beer!",
            "My friends and I have been going to this place every Saturday for the last 3 months. We've ordered beer after beer, tacos after tacos and loved the thin cut fries for the kids. It was our go to place for months as it felt both parent and kid friendly. Today the kids were extra excited and started making dinosaur noises. Typically this brewery plays pretty loud music and no one seems to care how much noise any one table is making. The server came by visibly annoyed and asked us to keep it down. We asked the kids to try to quiet down but these are two toddlers who were just having a good time while chatting about their dinosaur Halloween customs. We continued eating and a few minutes later the same server came by to give us the same message. At this point I think we'll take our business else where next weekend. It's a bummer that this place no longer feels welcoming to families in my humble opinion.",
            "Aside from a couple minor hiccups, this place is definitely a new favorite in the area! When I say minor, I'm talking little stuff like being told ALL beers can be used to build a flight, then ordering and finding out not all... after all. LOVE the outdoor patio and deck area, on a sunny day you can't beat it. It's not a huge place, so be prepared if it's busy. Come before or after rush, etc. The food is great. Ordered the Sacrilege burger, coastside po' boy, better than garlic fries and the ice cold pickle. Tip: skip the \"better than\" and go with regular fries. The sandwiches were really good, but I do wish they'd toasted the buns a bit so they didn't get as soggy from all the juicy deliciousness from the beef and shrimp. Favorite beer by Sacrilege - Huell Melon Saison",
            "Good food even better beers! Super easy, great staff.  We had some issues with our kid food, they just switch it right away.",
            "I've enjoyed Half Moon Bay Brewery often, butthis is one of the best places to have beer and some food.I didn't expect them to serve me very good foodbut surprisingly their food is good!I got shrimp sandwich last time and itwas fresh and tasty.It was cocked with butter I got Hawaiian chicken tacos this time.It looked simple when they served it to meBut when I tried it I was impressed.I'm picky with meat in general Unless it's really good quality.The chicken was really goodNo bad test or smell! Tasted very good and fresh.It's nice place to hang out with friends as well.That's it.If you enjoyed my review give me a thumbs up By the way service is nice and food was ready quick.",
            "Honestly, this place caters to some of my favorite things. Brunch(on Sunday's) and beer. Friendly/knowledgeable staff, great atmosphere. 10/10 would recommend.",
            "Usually, I agree with 4 stars, but tonight...not so much.  My word to the wise: if you are ordering for \"take-out,\" it is likely that your order will get lost in the shuffle. Cold burgers from Sacrilege are better than no burger at all, but the fresh ones are the best.",
            "Fantastic place to get some good beer (from Sacrilege or other craft breweries), and fantastic food. I ordered the Sacrilege Stout, PA Pierogies, Garlapeño Burger. The stout was on point, it was perfect after a day of walkingPA Pierogies, is a fried pierogies, I never had it like that, BUT it is great appetizerGarlapeño Burger is fantastic, burger with garlic and jalapeno,  it is a bit greasy and messy to eat, just the way I liked it. Just remember to wash your hand afterwards. Service is great.There are outside sitting area, I got here around 2PM on a Saturday and it was packed. Overall, a great place to get some yummy burger and beer.",
            "Friends and I just hiked 20 miles at Big Basin.  At this point, we were ravenous and settled on eating in Half Moon Bay since it was on the way back home.We seated ourselves and placed our orders.  First, we noticed that our friends who ordered a side of fries with their burgers were charged for a basket of fries instead. The difference was minimal ($5 vs $2) so we didn't make a huge fuss over it.As the orders were coming to our table, we noticed that one order was missing a fried egg on their burger and another was missing avocado that we paid an extra $2.50 for.  My friend ordered a buffalo chicken burger and got a plain chicken burger.  Now, we were starting to sense a pattern.  The fish tacos were horrendous.  The battered fish was rock hard and for a brewery you'd think they would beer batter their fish.  The fish had no seasoning and the slaw lacked flavor.  The buffalo chicken burger never made it to our table and the chicken patty in the plain burger was so thin that all you get is the buns and veggies. All in all, the quality of food and service are severely lacking at this establishment.  How do you have 4 stars?The only good thing here is their beer selection which is why I gave 2 stars vs 1."

            "Been here maybe 4-5 times and for a place that has poke in its name, you think I would've tried it by now.. but nope. For me their ace is their garlic fried chicken. Masubi, rice plate, loco moco, whatever -- you just absolutely need to try their GFC. IDK if that's a thing but I'm gonna call it that now bc garlic fried chicken is such a long thing to type haha. It's perfectly juicy yet crunchy, has just the right amount of garlic, and the serving size is enough to fill me and sometimes even leave me with leftovers. WOOOORTH IT. I feel like I say this a lot because there really is nothing going on in San Bruno, but this is a much needed addition to the area. It's modern, clean, and spacious which I think you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere in that part of downtown. Overall, super excited to have this place in my 'hood! Promise I'll try poke the next time I come back..which will probably be super soon hehe.",
            "When I think of Sam Choy and Hawaii, what comes to mind are two things: great food, and a welcoming environment with customer service that encompasses the Ohana spirit. The San Bruno Sam Choy's Poke To The Max, while having great food, falls extremely short in the customer service metric.  I will explain why I felt overlooked and ultimately made to feel awkward given my expressed excitement about coming in to eat here yesterday.  Yesterday afternoon, I walked in really happy that a Sam Choy's was here in San Bruno and I greeted the two young ladies at the counter. I have to admit I was quite enthusiastic about being there and explained I was new and it was my first time ordering. One of the female cashiers was training a new employee, another female. Both didn't make eye contact not greet me with a welcome. They were both just very serious, stoic, no smiles and just so cold, it seemed.  What led me to further feel this way was that the cashier trainer was reluctant to answer my questions about the different food items. I admit I did have alot of questions because I was new and hoping to establish a relationship for future business both personal and for catering, but the young lady training the new girl made me feel like I was an annoyance and being very short and snippy with her answers to my questions. I even had to ask again for clarification which was met with the same apathy towards me.  The way that I was made to feel was a barometer indicating bad customer service, especially because I had a preconceived notion of Ohana and Aloha spirit. The impression that I got was that they wanted me to just order my food and leave.These concerns of poor customer engagement and service are not unfounded.  I am a travel and service professional whose specialty is to cater to high value customers for my global company. I know what I'm talking about: I know how to be kind to people, I know how to engage with customers and certainly how not make them feel bad for asking questions, and I know how to treat people very well to ensure repeat business. It just really sucks when I am on the other side of the counter and don't get the basic service given to me as a customer.I truly hope these two young ladies are retrained to exhibit Hawaiian values of Ohana and Aloha spirit.Finally to make things worse, my to-go order was not correct. I ordered a Classic Poke platter to take to my mom and was given Spicy Poke.  My mom doesnt eat spicy, so that was another loss for me. I called the restaurant and I explained that my order was wrong and the girl said that someone would call me back to correct the error.  As of yet, no one has called me back.",
            "The name of the restaurant kind of throws you off. I am not a fan of poke at all, but once I found out that they have other food, I decided to give it a try.They have so much more besides poke. They have a whole Hawaiian menu. So far I've tried the garlic fried chicken, Korean fried chicken, and BBQ short ribs. All were very good. The to-go plate they give is deceptive. It's actually a lot of food.Their macaroni salad is okay. I've had better, but it's definitely not bad.Overall, nice, clean place. Very friendly, with good food.",
            "Although their food is amazing, their service is really slow. It's not a fast food restaurant but they just don't know how to prioritize. Rather they are busy or not, it takes a while for cashier to actually take the order. You see the people working there preparing orders or refilling stock but they don't acknowledge you for hella long. I tried calling in yesterday to order for pick up and they didn't answer once (out of 10 times) when I informed the girl at the register that maybe their phone isn't working. She carelessly said they haven't answered because they're too busy to answer and actually ROLLED HER EYES AT ME. That was my experience",
            "Wow!  Ono-licious.  This is the best poke outside of Hawaii.  I tried the salmon poke rice plate.  It had about 1/2 pound of poke, 2 scoops of rice with furikake, and a seaweed/sunomono salad.  For $12, very reasonably priced.  The ahi taco was delicious too but thought it was a little overpriced at $14.  $12 would be better.  I got maybe 6-8 cubes of ahi which maybe about 1/4 pound.Overall, both salmon and ahi poke were very tasty.  Not overly salty.  Good quality fish too.",
            "As a frequent traveler to Hawaii, I was very impressed!  So excited to have a good Hawaiian option in San Bruno!  Came here with a party of 5 on a Saturday for lunch.  The restaurant has quite a bit of seating and we had no problem getting a table.  We ordered an absurd amount of food because everything sounded so good.My favorite dish was the Garlic Fried Chicken.  It was so incredibly flavorful- sweet, garlicky, and was crispy and moist.  We had it in the plate lunch version and the musubi version.  I was also impressed by the firecracker shrimp, as there was a very generous portion of very large shrimp.  Really liked the fried shrimp with the aioli and unagi sauce.We also tried 2 poke bowls- the \"Mo Betta Shoyu\" and the \"Sriracha Sweetie\".  Both were well marinated and tasty. I was a little disappointed by the mac salad, as they include small pieces of celery in it.  I absolutely despise celery and I don't think is typical for mac salad in Hawaii.I will pass on the loco moco next time.  It was good, but wasn't as amazing as the other dishes we tried.  Definitely recommend checking this place out before it starts getting super crowded!",
            "I heard this was the latest and greatest thing in San Bruno so my co-workers and I rushed to try it.I had the Sam's bento which had spam Musubi, tempura, fried chicken, and beef teriyaki. The spam Musubi was super salty, then support was cold, the Fried Chicken was also cold, and the beef teriyaki was too well done for my taste and too chewy I ended up throwing most of it away because my plastic fork couldn't even cut through it.The cook in the back needs to not warm up the chicken, and halfway fry it to save time, because that's what I'm tasting, a cook who doesn't care.We had two kinds of poke, the soy sauce tuna one which was bland, and the spicy tuna one which was a bit better.The problem we had with the tuna was it had a lot of sinewy chewy pieces that were hard to digest and chew so whoever was cutting the tuna didn't do a good job. Nobody wants to eat those chewy white sinewy pieces.I think the hype got to most people for this place I don't think it's the best poke I've ever had nor do I think that this place lives up to the hype, but that's my opinion from the dishes that I had today.",
            "Wasn't sure what to expect from this restaurant having only ever heard of Sam Choy in a Hawaii five-o episode...Boy was this a pleasant surprise!The lady and I ordered the garlic chicken plate, sam's spicy poke plate, and the loco fries. Our favorite dish by far was the garlic chicken! I really enjoyed the sweet crunch texture and the portions were just right! As for the poke, it was pretty decent. Definitely tasted fresh and was a great compliment to the meal. The loco fries were definitely the filler plate with generous portions of tender Kalua pork and gravy topping a small mountain of fries.Only thing I'd have hoped for was the ability to order poke ala carte in a 1/3 lb size rather than minimum 1 lb. pricing per plate was about what you'd expect if not a dollar or two higher...But I'd more than happily return just for that garlic chicken!",
            "It isn't often you wait 25 years between meals from one of your favorite cooks.  I met Sam Choy 25 years ago when he was filming a segment at the hotel I was staying at on the Big Island of Hawaii.  He held his own against Alan Wong and Roy Yamaguchi.  His Spam Masubi was awesome.  What  is great is that he brings you true Hawaiian people food the way they eat it in a super casual atmosphere.Although this location is in a less traveled area of San Bruno, as soon as I saw his name in Yelp, I had to check it out!  His poke made this Bay Area native travel to this part of town for the very first time ever.Parking was a little difficult and location/signage was hard to identify except I saw the online photos and recognized it.  I think people have no clue about this place yet, as there was only one other couple here.  We stuck with a classic ahi poke rice plate, some katsu and masubi.  I spoke with the other customer and she was from Kona and we talked surfing and Sam Choy.  We both agreed their poke was so much better than other places in the Bay Area.  They use specific fishermen, the size and cut of their poke, and the seasonings make this place unique.  This place was so good!  The masubi pieces were huge! They are going to have some food trucks soon.Sam, my brudda.... come on by... I want to talk to you with some business ideas",
            "This was my first time trying Poke that was as authentic as you can get to the real thing, so bare with me I'm a bit of a newb when it comes to real poke. ANYWAYS. Sam Choy's was as close to the real thing as I'd imagine! LOL the flavor was all there. It didn't come in your conventional bowl how it does at most Poke places, which I was not expecting, but it doesn't mean it wasn't bomb. We got a poke plate which came with rice, seaweed salad and avocado. The poke was super good. Super flavorful, I was only disappointed in the fact that I didn't get to try all of them!! Truth be told, next time I might just opt for a \"pound of poke\" which is about 18 bucks. Not because the rice and salad wasn't good, but I would much rather just have the amazing poke and share it! I also got the Loco Fries. Which were fries with Kalua pork on top of it and a fried egg. All super good. Side bar, I think I've come to the realization that I just don't like Kalua pork. It doesn't mean it was bad by any means, just felt like sharing. ANYWAYS. If you like Kalua pork, then I'm sure you'll love the Loco fries! Super big, and a reasonable price. My two favorite phrases when it comes to food! I'll be back to try more next time!! 5/5 burritos!",
            "Mo' Betta Shoyu: 5/5 poke was nicely flavored, rice was a bit salty from the furikake seasoning on top. Classic Shoyu: 4/5 refreshing and light Sam's Spicy: 3/4 slightly too much aioli making it feel heavier Da Chicken Spam Musubi: 4/5 Chicken was nice and crispy. Fell apart easily.",
            "Was so excited to try authentic poke in the bay area, since I've been obsessed ever since my Maui trip earlier this year. My friends and I decided to do takeout, as we weren't sure how crowded it would be in the restaurant and we didn't want to wait.My friend and I called in our order on Saturday around 12:20. The one thing I thought was weird about calling in our order was that they took our credit card over the phone. I'm not used to giving my credit card for a takeout order, but apparently their system doesn't let them complete an order without the payment information.Unfortunately they force you to order a pound of poke, which doesn't make much sense since they let you split it into half pounds of two different types of poke. We opted for a half pound each of the standard shoyu salmon and tuna. It's $18.99/pound for all of their poke.The restaurant was pretty empty when we went to pick it up around 12:30.One friend and I both ordered the loco moco with a beef patty ($11.99), but unfortunately the patty was a little dry and hard to chew. Another friend got the loco moco with katsu chicken, and that was much better.Both the salmon and tuna poke weren't as well flavored as we were expecting. They were light on the soy sauce and overall flavor and was disappointing compared to the poke I had in Maui earlier this year. The poke in the bottom of the container was a little bit better flavored, but you'd think that for pre-mixed poke, the flavor would be evenly mixed throughout.We each paid ~$20 pp.",
            "Sometimes it's just better to forget about California-style, customizable poke and leave it to the chef! Sam Choy is a veteran of Hawaiian cuisine--leave it up to him to open an authentic poke restaurant in nondescript downtown San Bruno, of all places! The atmosphere is clean and casual, and the servers were so friendly as well, offering us free samples before we picked what to order. The poke rice plates here are just beautifully plated on disposable \"wooden\" plates with two scoops of white rice topped with furikake, greens, seaweed salad, pickles, and your poke of choice--I tried the tako kimchi, a mixture of cooked, chopped octopus with kimchi, cucumbers, and onion. The poke was a little bit subtler in flavor than I expected, but nothing a dash of sambal won't fix! I also tried the tacos (which come 3 to an order), which were each made of a soft tortilla on the outside wrapping two halves of a hard shell tortilla on the inside. The soft tortilla was spread with a unique edamame hummus, and the tacos were filled with a creamy cole slaw and a spicy aioli, along with ahi tuna poke (the spicy tuna was my favorite, since the fish was so tender and the marinade so flavorful). Come for the great prices, clean atmosphere, and above all, the fresh, tasty food at Poke to the Max! That or, you know.. fly to Hawaii.",
            "Poke!  poke! Siracha sweetie $12.99Minus the avocado Ahi tuna gluten free sweet shoyu, with Siracha and sweet onion. I would have never notice this place if there was not a couple fliers in the the window with pictures of there food selection. To draw more attention, and have people less baffled a sign on top of the business would be more helpful. They employees are awesome and are quite helpful even while your wait.  And  Hawaiian music in the background. I love the cool chalk board for the kids to keep draw on to keep them entertain.My favorite part out of this place is the huge poster board of what the \"definition of Poke.\"  Nice touch.",
            "Walking into Sam Choy's, I had a bit of an idea of what to order (always Yelp research first), but I still took some time to peruse the menu. I think I was probably most disappointed in the fact that you can't try a bit of everything if you are ordering as an individual because everything is standard/supersized (like the handcrafted musubi).So unlike many poke places that operates with a build your own model, Sam Choy's only offers a standard rice place option which comes with mixed greens and pickled vegetables, rice (2 scoops), and one choice of fish. Mentally, I'll admit, the lack of choices and flexibility made the plate feel more expensive upfront.But don't judge a book by its cover.I thought my rice plate was very filling. The rice is not the fluffiest, but I liked the topping of furikake to add extra flavor. My choice of spicy salmon was also very good. The fish was good quality and cubed nicely with no noticeable connective tissues (which makes the fish, like any other meat, tough and chewy). It was also coated thoroughly, but not over generously, with spicy mayo. Admittedly, I did choose this because it was the freshest looking choice 6pm. But moving on, I thought the pickled vegetables did a good job cutting the fattiness of the fish. The fresh seaweed was also a nice touch as was the seaweed salad. I wish the side salad only consisted of these elements because the mixed greens were not a favorite, especially without any kind of dressing. Pro-tip for the curious: You can ask to sample if you are truly indecisive. I opted to sample the sriracha sweetie (ahi tuna), which had good flavor but texture was a bit too chewy for my liking.  All in all, it was a good meal. I still want to try the garlic chicken (offer it as a side please!) and the musubi (offer the hand crafted ones in a smaller size please!).Conclusion: Bring friend. Try more food.",
            "Ok, celebrity chef restaurant...the food must be good. I came in with friends on a Sunday evening around 5:30pm. There was only a party of 2 before us so I'm not sure what went wrong with our order.We ordered our food at the counter than sat down and waited for our food to arrive. Ok, the simplest dish containing poke came out first. Understandable since the poke is literally sitting in the fridge display. My friend said the poke was a little too salty for her liking. About 5 mins later, the next dish...spam musubi. The ratio of spam and egg to rice was off. There was too much rice. 5 mins later, we then received the next dish. But oddly, a couple that ordered after us received the same exact dish minutes before us. How did that happen? Maybe orders were mixed up in the kitchen. One of our dishes was cold, so I thought it was just sitting on the counter. Finally, we received the last dish but the first person already finished eating. It was very awkward. I understand the restaurant is new, but food for a party should come out at approximately the same pace.To apologize for the delay in the food coming out, they offered us poke to go...but they revealed that they would just toss the poke at the end of the day anyways. I overheard the waitress giving other people free poke with their order so I guess close to closing is prime time to come eat or get take out if you want extra food for free.Overall, first impression of Sam choy was not good. Maybe it's just the celebrity name giving this place all the buzz.",

            "This place is really good. It's not marketed anywhere and basically a word of mouth place. The chef is the previous chef of Yume, and most of his customers here are ones that used to go there before it closed. The only way to reserve is to message him or the business on Facebook as there isn't a phone to call and no website. Kind of hard to find, because it's inside of another restaurant. Look for Impressions and walk upstairs and it is literally a bar counter. A little strange to be sure, but that doesn't really matter - you're here for the fish (and the view), not the ambiance.Look, you may be hesitant to spend the $100 on a restaurant with no reviews and seemingly no way to make a reservation. And I wouldn't blame you. But this is a place that could get a star and Tsuyoshi really loves his craft. Ask him how he even got this place as it's an impressive story. Seriously, this is Japan-level quality.",
            "I've bookmarked Yume in Alameda for a while but never got a chance to go and heard that they closed. I found this place from the old Yume Yelp and I'm so glad I tried it out. This place is located inside of the Impressions restaurant, 2nd floor. I made reservation through their Facebook page. Plenty of parking and the view is gorgeous! Usually when you do omakase, they will serve you with some soups and light appetizer plus dessert. Here, it's strictly nigiri. You get 12pcs of nigiri for $90 and you can order extra supplements if you'd like. The nigiri is pretty big so we were full after the 12 pcs and only ordered extra toro. Love all the fish we tried and love all the background story about where the fish is from and some history on why he opened this place. I wish they give some dessert in the end, but other than that, we're satisfied with our meal!",
            "Amazing 12-piece Omakase Nigiri Dinner presented by Tsuyoshi \"Andrew\" Kamogawa, son of Hideki (owner of Yume in Alameda). If you're looking for the \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" experience, go here. You do not get to pick anything but your alcohol (unless you have a food allergy that the Chef can accommodate). Think Seinfeld's Soup Nazi but nicer. You sit and you eat what you're fed. You do not get soy sauce, additional wasabi, but have pickled ginger to cleanse your palates with. We were not disappointed! Andrew described each item he fed us, why certain pairings were made, origin of the fish, etc. Made a special sauce to top all the Nigiri with. Not only were we full at the end of the meal, we asked for more of certain items (for an extra fee of course). All the fish fresh from Japan delivered that morning! This is not a meal meant for the regular Moe. It is an experience to savor what Japan has to offer close to the Bay Area.If you are a picky eater, don't come. If you need to bring your kids, don't come. If you drown your sushi in sauce, don't come. If you don't want to pay top dollars for top notch sushi, don't come.Leave the slots available for us who can enjoy it!This place is reservations only. Reservations requires contacting Andrew on Facebook. You cannot call or book online. Note that there are only 8 seats & currently 5 slots available each week (Fri & Sat at 5 & 7:30 pm; Sun at 3 pm)",
            "Maboroshi is located inside of Impressions on the second floor. As for the experience, absolutely amazing. Thank you for such an amazing experience. I managed to track down Tsuyoshi via the Yume Sushi Yelp page, and surprised my fiancé for our 7 year anniversary with dinner here. The open bar presentation gives a fantastic view of  Chef Tsuyoshi as he prepares each course. The Chef is charismatic and open to answering questions, whether it be about details of the fish or his tools. He was happy to indulge in showing my fiancé his knives as well, as my fiancé collects knives. The location of Maboroshi gives you a prime view of the bay as well, adding to a wonderful atmosphere. The fish is extremely fresh and prepared in a delicate manner that really showcases the taste of each fish. I have yet to experience a better omakase. Chef Tsuyoshi has spoiled us too much.  I was too excited to take a picture of the first nigiri. Our magical visit to Yume Sushi was around 3 years ago. Our anniversary dinner at Maboroshi was just as amazing, if not more so.",
            "So happy Chef Tsuyoshi reopened - we had previously dined at Yume which  on it's own was a memorable experience. Dined at his new spot last night with my wife (just got married this past Sunday). It was very intimate - just the 2 of us at the sushi bar since this was the first Wednesday he decided to open.As always, a delightful, delicious, affordable, and amazing experience - fresh ingredients that is carefully prepared to give you an orgasmic dining experience especially if you love sushi. Hands down best sushi we've had in California.",
            "My husband and I came for dinner. We sat during his 5pm seating.His 12 course meal was delicious and fresh. The chef is very eloquent and friendly. I took one star for the simple reason that the ambiance and vibe of the place could be elevated a bit. The service also lacked. We brought a bottle of wine and had to serve ourselves the entire time.The sushi bar is in a weird location, as it is inside a French restaurant. It just feels odd.The $90 pp price tag is also a bit too much considering that the place, service and overall vibe cheapens the experience.",
            "I have been searching for Andrew for a long time since my favorite Yume Sushi in Alameda has closed. Here he is in Half Moon Bay!!! You will be never disappointed by the quality of food and the experience here. Unlike those high end fancy places in SF where you pay more for its atmosphere, interior decor, locations, etc, here you are paying for the quality of the ingredient and the excellence of the chef. The sushi master Andrew is like a walking encyclopedia of sushi, fish, Japanese food culture, etc. We're here for 7:30 session, it was already dark, but I can imagine how beautiful it is sitting against the Marina. So if you like the ocean view, book the 5:00pm session for the sunset. Highly recommend it!!!",
            "Location is near the ocean, and you get a great view of the sea while dining which is a plus. There are two opening slots which needs reservations, one starts at 5 pm to 7:30 pm, the other goes from 7:30 (roughly) to 10:00pm. The meal has 12 courses, the opening courses were mind blowing, each bite was packed with great flavors and the fish just melts in your mouth. With that being said, I wish the meal would end on a powerful note too, maybe the toro at the end could be seared and add a bit more flavor. The chef also offered free tamago for us, which is so kind of him, it was made by his father, and it was delicious! Overall, I think the price is quite fair, especially when broken down, a piece of sushi ranges from $4.50 to 6.50. I also liked the service, the waiter was attentive.",
            "Dec 1 2018Not Open though it says they are Open...Call the Number, they said not open for at least 2 weeks?Strange!",
            "Tsuyoshi from Yume got a place of his own in Half Moon Bay! It's definitely worth the trip for incredible sushi made with care and reverence. He still serves favorites like kelp marinated scallops but has new items such as salt cured sardines.Every bite is delicious and he doesn't skimp on quality. There's a well curated sake list as well.",
            "I never got to try Yume in Alameda, but then I got the secret tip about Maboroshi from a friend. I would have never thought to go out to Half Moon Bay for sushi. I guess Yume had to close due to some unfortunate non business related circumstances, but chef Tsuyoshi came out to Half Moon Bay for this new venture. The sushi bar is 8 seats on the 2nd floor of this large building with 3 restaurant concepts in it (sushi bar, regular Japanese food, and French food?)We were lucky to be the only ones at the sushi bar on a random weeknight, so it was a private dining experience. The chef is knowledgeable and was able to tell us interesting things about the various types of fish we had. Starting with sake, everything was hand picked by the chef. For example, the sparkling sake is fermented naturally and not just carbonated sake.  We had two half bottles that he recommended, and prices were very reasonable - $16.50-19.50 for 300-350 ml bottles. Sushi: 1. Maguro: big eye tuna from the Marshall Islands - beautiful color 2. Albacore belly: from British Columbia, with soy marinated garlic and scallions 3. Mature yellow tail: buri - a rare find in the US! Straight from Japan.  It was more buttery and tender than regular hamachi 4. Hotate: from Hokkaido, marinated in kelp, with a squeeze of lemon - the scallops were super sweet 5. Scottish salmon: torched, topped with, lemon juice, scallion, and spicy daikon. I don't usually like salmon, but the torched flavor with everything else went well6. Amber jack 7. Black Sea bream: torched, with a Japanese yuzu/citrus powder and scallion 8. Canadian spot prawn: I usually find ama ebi too slimy, but this spot prawn was very fresh and sweet. That said, I'm just not a big fan of raw ebi. 9. Shima aji: from Japan, topped with scallion 10. Uni: from Hokkaido; served with nori 11. Katsuo: lightly cured, topped with soy marinated garlic, shredded shiso, ginger, and a ponzu vinaigrette - this was like a flavor bomb 12. Otoro: torched toro belly from Spain - very buttery, melts in your mouth The katsuo and albacore belly were my favorite pieces. It was also cool to try buri, since it's not a common fish in the US. It was $90 for 12 pieces, but each of the pieces was like 2.5x the size you get at most places in SF, so if left us quite full. We did do an extra add on - a Saba that wasn't on the menu. Shockingly, the a la carte was only around $5 a piece, which is a steal compared to other sushi places. Dining with chef Tsuyoshi was educational and fun. The sushi itself was generous in portion size and was fresh. It wasn't quite as refined as some of the omakase places in SF, but it was a great value and was still a good sushi experience in an unconventional space, without having to go to SF. Currently, reservations are via Facebook messenger with the chef. Definitely make a reservation.",
            "I was a regular at Yume Sushi in Alameda and I was so happy when Andrew opened Maboroshi. It really is \"as good as it gets\".  In a true Sushi experience, it is important that each piece served is from the best sources and prepared. The rice is also important as the freshness of the fish.  At Maroboshi, Andrew accomplishes the above where each piece melt in your mouth followed by perfectly textured rice.  The soy sauce is homemade.  The wasabi is from a fresh root unlike artificial wasabi served at most sushi restaurants. The chef puts the perfect amount of wasabi and coats the fish with soy sauce.   The ambiance is great with views of the boats docked at the wharf.  There is a beautiful flower arrangement on the counter.So reviews are not confused, there are multiple restaurants in the building: French, sushi/bento (on the 1st floor)  and Maboroshi which is Omakase sushi on the 2nd floor.  I believe that reviewer who gave Maboroshi one star was making a review of sushi/bento counter on the 1st floor since Maboroshi only has Andrew and one server.  There is no bartenders or multiple chefs behind the counter.",
            "great delicious sushi..chef is very friendly and informative. our bill came out to be $300 for 2 people because we ordered more but it was all worth it"

            "CAN I give this place 10 stars?  Love this place and love half moon bayI had a few margaritas here that were great- not too strong and not too weak.  The staff is super chill and friendly as is the vibe. The food is incredible and may very well be one of the best and freshest fish'n'chips I have ever had in my life- Kudos to Noel!!!The out door are is incredible and would be the perfect set up for an outside band.  The succulents literally made my heart so happy.",
            "Decent food if the staff decides they want to make it. Ordered a loco moco and after waiting 15 minutes the staff tells us they didn't make the rice and asked what we wanted instead. Hm ... a loco moco isn't really a loco moco without rice but ok. We asked for some whole wheat bread instead and they were about to give us just the bread but nothing else from the loco moco. Yeah for $12 that doesn't work at all. Finally got fed up and asked them what they could actually make, which turned out to be a burrito ($9.50 on the menu). Still no refund offered since we paid $12 for a loco moco. Had to tell them they owed us $2.50 and the guy at the counter stared at us blankly until we explained why we overpaid. The purple shark bowl was pretty good. But given that there were 5 people working here and only the one older gentlemen making the hot food knew anything about they had in stock is strange.",
            "We ordered a LOCO MOCO. The rice wasn't fully cooked since we were the first ones there. The taste is Ono, good surrounding, Hawaiian music, friendly staff...Just cook the rice a little longer  n will see y'all next  time. Aloha and Mahalo",
            "$4 for about four ounces of root beer. 12 oz glass full of ice. No refills, unless you complain. To quote our statesman in the White House, SAD.Good burgers and other food.",
            "It's a very accessible and fun bar with a great location. Great selection of beer on tap.I wish the staff were more attentive. I don't know if it's because we aren't locals, but every time we visit (approximately 6 times a year), it's like the staff serves you once and forgets you. I don't think they mean this is a rude way, they just seem to get involved in convos with everyone they know since we aren't one of those people or groups, we get looked over.",
            "I recently went back here about 6 months ago. A lot has changed! The food is great, my experience was great.. met some locals I had seen but didn't know. The shenanigans are still rampant... but it makes for a fun Late Sat night!",
            "First time at Half Moon Bay. Went to this restaurant for breakfast on a Monday. It seemed like we were the first ones there. We were craving for some Loco Moco. They told us the rice was still cooking and we were ok with waiting. However, when the food was served, the rice was still uncooked. Nothing worse than an uncooked rice on a Loco Moco. The gravy did not have onions and a little lackluster. Staff was friendly enough. Nice decor/paintings on the wall. Very disappointing nonetheless.  Mahalo for the time but not worth going back.",
            "This is my first time here.  When we come to Half Moon Bay, we usually just hang out by the water.  It's nice to sit with locals.  They are all very nice!",
            "I took my daughter to OPL for lunch. They have a diverse menu inspired by the owners' travels across the world. Normally, I'm hesitant about restaurants that offer Thai, Mexican, California cuisine because I think you should focus on one cuisine and do that well. But OPL pulls it off. Prices are ok. Everything is locally sourced and tastes fresh. The grill is attached to a bar though separated. The place is kid-friendly and you can bring your dog through a separate door into the large, newly designed patio. The patio is fantastic and offers ample space for kids to run around while parents can enjoy a chilled draft and fresh calamari (so good!). I have not tried any cocktails from the bar. Make sure to pass the brewery on the same street and head straight to OPL. Highly recommend that place!",
            "Great little place... fresh fish tacos, and oddly enough great spicy wings. Love the dive bar and outdoor bier garden connected to it.",

            "Slow morning fishing on the beach so decided to grab some grub here.  This is a tucked away spot in half moon bay with good heart food.  Ordered the calamari and fish tacos, too much sea fare you say? No way.  If I can't catch fish for lunch, better be able to go buy some fish. Low key atmosphere, good food, bar next door looks like fun too but maybe later in the day.",
            "We asked for a burger medium rage and got it well done. The fries are limp, greasy and inedible. Two star because the salad was good.",
            "Looking for a local location this is the place to go. Super great crowd and they're super friendly to everyone. Every bartender I dealt with over the weekend was super friendly and made you feel like you were one of the locals. Drinks are strong they do not mess around!  I will definitely be coming back! Cheers",
            "Just ate here and ordered a salad and the chicken tenders. Watched the chef handle raw chicken and then prepare the salad without washing his hands or changing gloves. Crossing my fingers I don't get sick from the two bites I had of the salad. Biggest no-no when it comes to preparing food, which all chefs should be very cognizant about.",
            "If you're looking for some high quality grub in a locals-only setting in HMB, this is the place to go. Off the beaten path, generally not too busy, good local beers, friendly staff, and high quality food. It's a bit pricey, and you wait a while for the food, but overall a great place to get some food. Give it a go. Check out the nights with music if you have a chance.",
            "Hell Yeah. This place rules. The best fish and chips in town good beers and great people.",
            "We were visiting Half Moon Bay to crab for a few days. On the last night we decided to go out and check out the local scene. So we went to the bar closest to our RV parking spot! This place had a older crowed and an awesome live band with horns. Someone bought everyone a round so that was cool. We ordered some bar food it was all very good! Overall we enjoyed ourselves fully!",
            "Reviewing mostly for Silver Star Grill next door... What a great find. The lady and I went for a walk from Beach House hotel to Mavericks and came across a bunch of restaurants along the way. This one had a sign outside that said \"Voted Best Burger on Yelp.\" The Yelp reviews looked good enough to give it a try.The prices are great--especially considering how expensive other restaurants in the area are. We got calamari, a burger with fries, and the Hawaiian plate for $25 total.The calamari was a bit different than usual: both the seasoning (kind of spicy) and the shape (like fish sticks). It was a nice change of pace, and we both enjoyed it.She got the burger, which was charbroiled and very good (and we eat a lot of burgers). It also came with tasty fries.I got the Hawaiian plate--kahlua pork, rice, and macaroni. I couldn't pass once I saw it on the menu--there were actually several things besides the burger that looked worth a try. This was not the best Hawaiian plate I've ever had, but it hit the spot and did not disappoint. It was a good amount of food, too.Definitely worth another visit if we are in the area.",
            "We come here every time we are in town!  Love this place! Fresh caught fish!  Hawaiian bucket is ono!  The loco moco looks good!  Super family and dog friendly!!!  Wear layers, it can get chilly in the back patio."

            "For a beach community restaurant this is about as good as it gets.  We came here for dinner and was not disappointed.Casual yet better quality food than you may expect to find.There is a lot of interesting memorabilia an idea art to admire and it feels coastal.We had a cozy enough table and there is both indoor and outdoor seating.I started with a specialty cocktail, a Spicy Margarita, that was OK.  It was packed with alcohol, so for 12 bucks you're getting your money's worth.Then I tried 6 half shelled oysters. Again good, but not a knock your socks off. The flavor was just so-so that might be indicative of the type. The shells, however, were quite beautiful.I went on to have a menu special, the Portuguese Fisherman's Stew that was robust and quite delicious.  The flavors and mix of fish and shellfish were just right, although some broken mussel shell was in the stew. Fortunately it didn't lead to any dental issues! The stew flavor was the best part.The accompanying bread was excellent.Overall service was friendly and top notch. He was attentive and served professionally.We ended with a mud pie...oh my! Most filling and delicious but difficult to eat.  It was frozen so hard it took a sledge hammer to break it apart, but nonetheless worth it.Fun, interesting place and the BEST part was the music.  A duet on piano and cello that were most delightful and great background music for dinner. BRAVO!",
            "This place is not good. Like the other reviews mention, it's overpriced and the food is bad. I try to avoid low rating restaurants like Sand Dollar, however we had no reception to check out the available area restaurants and ended up here after a lady at the store next door recommended it. That was a bad recommendation!The service and interior is decent here, but it's the unpalatable food that brings it down. The \"grilled\" oysters are bland tasting and not grilled at all (more like lukewarm without any evidence of a grill). The fisherman's soup was quite bad. The sauce had no depth, the mussels tasted salty and old, and several of the clams were undercooked. Some of the worst seafood I've had in the Bay area. The only decent dish was the salmon, which tasted alright.Overall, I highly recommend against this place. However the options are limited in the area so plan ahead!",
            "This place is always the best . Their oysters are fresh and insanely good .we don't roll through Stinson without stopping here . Some of our favs , fish tacos , seafood risotto , spicy wings , all the pastas, fresh crab , basically everything .",
            "So back for an afternoon drink and light bite and let's just say encounters with the staff were off-putting. A little graciousness and politeness goes a long way. But on this day, definitely this was lacking with several staff. Even a quick visit to the bathroom was a dodging exercise for staff almost running into me or over me. I don't except a red carpet but mutual consideration for maneuvering past people at the least would be classy. Also my salad was riddled with slimy past prime leaves. I barely ate it and the waitress never bothered to check or ask how the food was. She saw the plate almost untouched when asking if we were ready for the bill but disappeared before I could even comment. Not feeling the vibe this round...Old review: M'WORD!!! I don't know how the Sand Dollar doesn't have a 5 star rating on YELP. Charm by the bucketful with little white lights and red geraniums, and a white picket fence look. A lovely patio with heaters to dine under the stars. We arrived famished just as they were closing. There weren't many options nearby that were open and so we were so glad to be able to get dinner after lounging on the beach till sunset. My Argentine roots have a way of creeping in with late night dinners. 10 pm is early for dinner back home. You can go to a restaurant that is fully crowded at 2 am in Buenos Aires. We had a few quick minutes to scan the menu before putting our order in as the kitchen was closing. I went with the special-the steak. In my rush, I mistakenly thought it was listed at $14 instead of $30. So I was just blown away with how deliciously tender and tasty my \"$14 steak\" was. Haha! But even for $30 it was a dream. The potato and au jus just made it so full of flavor. My better half had the swordfish, which he really liked. We had fun sharing both entrees. We shared a chocolate lava cake which was okay but nothing amazing compared to the entrees. The bar had a bunch of happy peeps crowded around it even as the dining areas were clearing out. The staff were friendly and chill. I was really surprised with how good the food was, and especially with the 3 star rating on yelp. I would love to come back again.Sadly I lost quite a lot of photos when my iPhone died and so I can't share the food or restaurant pics so you have to put on your imagination caps and visualize the goodness!!",
            "This place is a solid 3 star. I went here with friends and family in the summer and then, I would have given a 5 star review. This last time we went, they earned a 1 star review, so the average of those two dining experiences is a 3.They have a good variety of seafood and non-seafood options year-round. Last summer, I had a delicious salmon and slaw sandwich accompanied by excellent cocktails and even better service. The fresh seafood is amazing to order in the summer, in the winter, not so much. I was considering ordering the fish and chips, as I am not the biggest seafood fan, but the guy seated at the table about 6 inches from ours complained incessantly about how even a frozen Gorton's Fish Sticks would've been better. I went with the burger when our server finally showed (to be fair, they were under-staffed) and it had a very distinct bitter taste. The clam chowder was only thing that was good on such an off day.Great place in the summer! Work on your winter menu to reflect available fresh fish options and you'll be great year-round.",
            "This is a good, old-timey spot to enjoy on a nice day on the patio. It is reminiscent of something you would find on Cape Cod with the interior (and the food). The staff is friendly but seems overly busy which happens. The food was decent, but a little steep on pricing. They need it I'm sure to cover the winter months. I definitely will be back however.",
            "Overpriced menu that manages to stay in business due to touristy area/likely not many repeat customers. I was there for a weekend getaway. This place is a better bar than a restaurant. The only reason i give it two stars is because the servers were very friendly and accommodating. It must be tiresome to have endless 'on holiday' diners' faces frown when the entrees are placed on the table. What a disappointment. We ordered 1 doz oysters which were good yet overpriced (3$ each)Wedge salad drenched in bluecheese which is great for bluecheese lovers. Not so great for salad lovers...Clam linguini. Best dish of the night Halibut special. Returned because it was supposed to be a truffle cauliflower puree with local kale. But it was served with watery chard and a pile of slimy portobellas on diluted cauliflower. Blech.My entree #2 was salmon (also off the specials menu...) that was so rare on the inside that i could see the white fibrous membranes in the muscle sections. It's salmon not ahi! The friendly waitress told me when i called her over to inspect that the chef prepares it \"medium rare'. I sent the rest back.  Enjoy the beach then head to mill valley.",
            "We decided to give this place a try since it looked like a nice place to eat. BIG mistake! The food is way over priced; which I know you would expect but let me tell you about the food! Service was bad! Please see below: Wedge Salad - tiniest I have ever seen, lettuce was brown and blue cheese was old. When I showed it to the waiter, a short Hispanic man, he was offended and relied that there is no way for them to know what lies beneath the 1st layer.Clam Chowder - pasty but with food flavor Arugula pear salad - just don't try it!Fish & chips - all batter and coleslaw was oldGarlic fries - good Fried calamari - good We all drank water bill was over $100!!!Wish I would have read the reviews before we went.",
            "If you're out by the beaches around here, you'll find yourself limited on options of where to eat after 3pm (time that most local cafes close in this area)Pros:-Looks classy inside, white linen-Indoor and outdoor seating with heat lamps-Nice beach paintings (for sale at $400+)-Social bar area-Live music (piano and violin)Cons:-Pricy (as expected) - $7 for a side of fries, $16 for a simple burger -Exceptionally slow service-Gross restroom: no paper or soap-Disgusting mushroom pizza: my rock-hard flatbread could've been used to break a window, mushrooms burnt, and sauce non-existentSidenote:-They were nice enough to take the pizza off the tab-They have a $2 charge if you want to split the bill (yes, really.)",
            "I'm going to go out on a limb amongst my fellow Yelpers and give the Sand Dollar four stars. Why? Because you're in a remote beach village miles away from regular civilization. Need gas?  It's 14 mikes away over a windy road. Need a bone-in ribeye?  It's right here at the Sand Dollar!!  Need a St. George Botanivore gin Martini?  You got one right here at Sand Dollar!!People!!  Food at the coast is rarely good. You should know by now that you should temper your expectations when you're eating anywhere within about 1/2 mile from a coastline. I LOVE the Sand Dollar!!  The food here is a step up from coastal comfort food. They have a fun menu with things like halibut civiiche, choppino, fish and chips, and filet of sole. Yes, the service is a bit rough, but they mean well. We were seated right away. But, we did sit for a while before we were asked for drink orders. But our drinks came fast once ordered, and our martinis were excellent. Caesar salad was really good. We also ordered a dozen oysters that were perfect: fresh shucked with lots of oyster liquor!  We loved them. I had the petrole sole, that was excellent. My son had the special sea bass, and he devoured all of it. My other son had the burger, which was huge and juicy. Dessert was a bit of a miss. We had bread.pudding, but they were out of the other two desserts: a tart and a pie. The bread pudding was ok. In summary, we always enjoy Sand Dollar when we are at Stinson.  They have creative food, generous portions, and excellent cocktails!",
            "We stopped by Sand Dollar on a Sunday afternoon, after spending the morning hiking nearby. There weren't many choices nearby, so we decided to give this place a try. It couldn't be that bad right? ---- WRONGWe walked in and were seated immediately, that was nice. We ordered three appetizers to start with, garlic fries, steamed mussels and chowder to share.1. The garlic fries came out first...hot and right out of the fryer. We each started munching on it...then to realize...WHERES THE GARLIC AND PARMESAN  CHEESE? They forgot it!!So basically, it was just french fries. We told her server and he took it back to the kitchen. About 7 mins later he came out with GARLIC Fries. But sadly, they were cold and seem like the kitchen just tossed in some garlic and cheese...Disappointment yet again.2. The mussels came out shortly...however, it definitely wasn't hot and steaming. And definitely smelled weird...like mussels that have gone bad...seaweed like. I was not a fan either.3. The Chowder was a solid choice. Hot, fresh, and made delicious. We also ordered fish tacos - they were definitely bland and nothing special.The 16oz rib eye was cold, and lack flavors. Both dishes were a disappointment also. Another thing that bothered me most was the service.There was 4 of us in our party, they never brought us plates to share.Water was never refilled until requested. The place was fairly empty, and for most of the time, the servers were no where to be seen. Parking is limited. Bathrooms are clean. Food & service needs some help.",
            "We came around sunset and had a nice place outside the patio with a great sunset view. I recommend the garlic oyster and rack of lamb. Although the rack of lamb was on the pricier side, it was very delicious. They put this special beets sauce that compliments the medium well done steak so well. On the other hand, our food server was slow and the food came about 20 min after we ordered. Their lobster bisque that night was particularly too salty that I couldn't finish it. I was looking forward to having soup, but was disappointed by the uneven taste. I still recommended this place when you're coming back from Marin headlands. Nice ambiance and atmosphere. The food is a hit or miss. Do try the rack of lamb is you're feeling like spoiling yourself ;)",
            "Menu consists of updated pub fare to keep with the healthful mind frame of the area and times. You'll find some interesting specials like a lemon chicken soup that was the soup of the day. So the place tries to elevate options rather than only offering what you'd expect in the location, fried fish and chips. We noshed on a dry French rose wine which tasted more like a Chardonnay than a rose, but good nonetheless. Fried brussel sprouts with Asian dipping sauce and fish tacos. I had the prawn tacos which were quite generously filled with 3 prawns per taco, 2 per plate. The flavor fixings are the same whether you get swordfish, prawns or fried cod. A cool cabbage slaw with jalapeños aioli nicely topped the tacos adding some heat. Served on corn tortillas. We couldn't decide between breakers or here and really at the end of the day Sand Dollar is an institution in the area and was packed. Lovely outdoor seating with umbrellas to block some of the rays but still give you some warmth. I found the menu interesting for the area with the Asian flair items that left me curious for another return trip some day soon. I think the prices are on point and not too inflated considering the tourist trap nature of the town. Locals gotta eat too.",
            "Been coming here for years. First yelp review of this place. Love the drinks, beer selection, the food, and the service at the bar. Service at the tables is rarely acceptable. They got \"hey we're at the beach so lets chill\" routine down. And to a large degree that's what i want from this place, year-round. But lackadaisical, slow, forgetful, and sloppy service is not \"chill\" wherever you are. This could be a 4+ star beach restaurant if they would prioritize service like they do their food. Big plug for the delicious rib dish at a seafood restaurant. Nice.",
            "I came to Stinson Beach with my best friends for my birthday. And it was there, at the Sand Dollar Restaurant, that we were served by the great master of bee killing: Joseph. Joseph was friendly, funny, attentive, and did in mention he murdered an attacking yellow jacket at our table? We ordered multiple dishes to share (all excellent in tastiness) and our fabulous server answered all our weird questions with accuracy and tact. It was a great experience. I had a great birthday. Thank you Sand Dollar. Thank you Joseph, grand murderer of flying stinging things.",
            "New update: This is the third time, where the food was subpar. There are only two restaurants in Stinson so we keep ending up here. The fish and chips were soft and mushy. We had two orders and they looked completely different. One was crispy and one wasn't. Two clam chowders and one was awesome while the second one was runny. They are very inconsistent even when the restaurant is not busy. The wait staff is nice so I didn't give less stars. But the food is two stars at a push. It's very overpriced for what you're getting. Next time, we'll pack a picnic. Update: totally disappointed. Went back a second time, and the food was not as good. Even though the restaurant wasn't as busy, many of the items were not as good. The fish of the fish and chips tasted strange and the mussels were not as good as the first time. Calamari still good. I removed one star and hope next time is better. But we might go elsewhere. Not sure why they don't have 5 stars. The food is awesome especially for a touristy area. There's only a few restaurants here and this place is outstanding. Try the mussels and the creme brûlée.",
            "Went for a birthday party and couldn't wait to try the fresh fish that everyone raved about. Needless to say they were out of the catch of the day and the other \"special\" fish. Service was meh. Cocktails - dont order anything complicated like a bloody mary. My dish did not come out as described on the menu. The \"hash of potatoes and peppers\" became a small piece of cod on a bed of peppers - small fingerling potatoes on the side, many of which were so hard from over cooking I could not eat them.Lastly, the prices are way too high for what you get. A total disappointment.",
            "The service was friendly and the establishment was clean. We went for a few drinks and some mid afternoon snacking. The garlic fries were incredible.  Hot and crispy, seasoned with generous amounts of garlic and salt. The wings were standard bar food, but good.  The ahi tartar came with homemade chips that were aggressively salted, but the Ahi was fresh and the avocado plentiful.",
            "We had dinner here twice in 10 days because we were working in the area.The first time we had sketchy service, an overpriced tiny martini ($14) butthe scallops were delicious.  Today, we thought we would try those wonderful scallops again but horrors, we did not get the same delicate seafood but our entre came in a tired smear of what tasted like warmed-over mashed sweet potatoes with scallops cooked in bacon grease.   I tried to eat them but with each bite they got worse.  I asked the waiter to return the meal to the kitchen with the request to remove it from the check.  This apparently incensed the owner who came to the table to tell me to stop yelling (I spoke in a normal voice) charged me $28 for the $30 menu price.    He also informed me that he would have me escorted from the place if I didn't keep my voice down.  I spoke in a normal voice.  Luckily, we won't have to go here again for a long, long time.  By the way a big rottweiler sat next to our table in the dining room for most of our meal & begged.",
            "i am glad I did not look at Yelp before I went here or we would not have stopped.  Highway 1 was closed so we could not get further south.  We were starving and wanted dinner on the fly. The food was fantastic, and the service was excellent.  We loved the live music.  It was a great experience. My only thing was that I have asthma and the presto logs just suck for asthmatics.  We sat as far away as possible and that worked okay for me."

            "For the price of the food I would expect it to be out of this world, and we did not find one item that would make us come back.It was good, and edible but our bill for 4 people with one appetizer, 4 of their less expensive entrees and 3 alcoholic drinks  was $250 before adding tip. I don't mind paying that if the food is something I can't make at home, but this was not.Beautiful location and decor, very nice wait staff.",
            "La Costanera is one of our favorite restaurants in Half Moon Bay. We love watching the overlooking sunset; have brought relatives and visiting friends over for dinner and celebrate special occasions here many times.  As was the case with our most recent visit when we brought my in-laws after a stop to the local pumpkin patch with the kids to cap off my husband's last day of vacation.We ordered our usual appetizers: ceviche sampler, yuca balls and pulled pork bruschetta after giving our drink orders.  It is also kind of my last day of vacation myself before returning to our daily routines that involve two toddlers-so to relish it, I ordered a pina colada.  Even cracked a little joke to the waitress about pumping and dumping (breastfeeding reference for all you children-free folks).Anyway, fastforward to getting all our food including the main entres, all pretty happy, my drink arrived and it looks good.  Problem is prior to me realizing the drink is too strong, server already left.  Hailed her but she didn't see.  No problem, I kept myself busy with the food in front of me and I still had a coke and water with it.  I took a few more sips while waiting for her to see if I can enjoy it but no, still too strong!  Well it took her awhile to check back on our table that when she did I was 3/4s done with my plate already and when she asked \"how's everything?\" I along with everyone that replied the food was good, added with, \"My drink is a little too strong.\"  HER RESPONSE, \"YOU DON'T HAVE TO FINISH IT, ARE YOU OKAY?\"  and left.  My husband and I looked at each other and was like, Whaaat? Is she serious?  Yeah, we suddenly lost our appetite for dessert.It's service stuff like this that really irks me about establishments even when they have great food.  Also, makes me wonder if I looked white and blonde like her, would she even treat me that way?  Even if it isn't the case, it's not a good thought or feeling to leave your customers with.  It's a $15 dollar drink, I should be able to enjoy it instead of ordering another coke. Even then she was still being dense or just plain, could care less!  She also charged us a mandatory 20% gratuity even though our 6th person was a baby that was practically sleeping the whole time in his stroller and she didn't have to serve.  I'm sure she's enjoying her $53-dollar, self-imposed tip! As for us, we won't be coming back on a matter of principle.  At the end of the day, there's a lot of other restaurants to choose from.  I'm sure you can spend $350 dollars somewhere where you can get great food & service, and would actually remake your drink to your liking. Probably sans the obligatory gratuity which you would be happy to oblige as it would be well-deserved.",
            "After years of declining quality and service, this place is finally close to rock-bottom. Portions are now skimpy. The sangria is watery. Dishes are never served at temperature. They're never staffed to serve their customers well. They've reopened the patio finally, which is nice, but unless Hwy 1 is at a standstill, you're better off driving a bit further for another option. Might as well be the Chart House now.",
            "The location of the restaurant and the interior layout is beautiful, I loved the view as soon as I walked in the front door and could look out of the large windows to the ocean. The food is very good and, from what I was told, they stick to many of the Peruvian ingredients and recipes, though there may be some fusion ideas on the menu (like the mac and cheese), but I'm not sure. I did think it was a tad expensive, not just in terms of the food you order, but things like you have to pay for additional chips after the first complimentary small bowl, even if you order ceviche.",
            "Well I'm going to be honest parking sucks. There's two parking lots on each side but very small. It is public parking for people who go to the beach so that's not their fault. There's a big bench where you can sit outside. As soon as you walk in the hostess is there to greet you. The have a computerized map of the tables I was very impressed with the technology they had. It's my second time here. The restaurant has beautiful ocean views. There's a downstairs and we were sat upstairs. There was a big glass that was in front of us and we were able to see all downstairs. It was a lot more intimate compared to the downstairs. The lights are dim and they have candles very romantic. The service flows very smoothly here and waiters and waitresses help each other. We ordered ceviche 3 ways and the fish was absolutely delicious. Then we had the arroz chafa was the best I've ever had. It had pork belly I think pretty freakin amazing. My husband ordered a steak he said it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I ordered a seafood strew that came with a side of white rice that was really really good. I added the lemon juice that was spicy from the ceviche that just completely topped it off. My husbands plate came with what seemed as a basic green salad but I could taste lemon and sea salt it was so freakin good. I can't stop thinking about it. We ordered two desserts cookies called alfajores in a heart shape they were definitely worth getting. The best part was the second dessert the churros and got chocolate best thing ever. If you go you have to get the churros they were simply perfect. Definitely worth the drive it was amazing.",
            "We went there for lunch few days ago... food was tasteless, usually Peruvian food is quite tasty (not here).Service was rude and we didn't feel welcome.",
            "We really loved our meal here. The nightly special was excellent and they had a separate menu that had gluten-free, vegan and vegetarian options. I love being able to look out at the beach at the great view. The restaurant was crowded. I will definitely come back again. Service was excellent with Alex, a native from Peru!!",
            "My husband and I had a wonderful evening for Valentine's Day at La Costanera! The layout and the decor are wonderful, the service was great and the food delicious! It was expensive but if you want to celebrate a special occasion I think it's absolutely worth it!! The atmosphere was friendly; everyone looked like they were having a good time. I definitely recommend this restaurant as a special place with food that will transport you to exotic places!!",
            "Went to La Costanera for dinner with my team. Great services, food and drinks. I ordered pisco sour. Mmmm! So delicious. I also ordered Seco de Cordero( lamb shank) with a side order of garlic spinach. The lamb is So very tastie and very tender. Highly recommended. Definitely will come back !",
            "Hmmm....where to start?  We have been passing this place for a while without eating there but always have wanted to try it.  Soooo, tonight we had the time and were able too so we did.Ambiance:  - who doesn't love eating over the oceanService:  Food:  MehPrice:  The food wasn't worth the price but I suppose you are really paying for the location/viewSorry La Costanera-  I really wanted to love you.  I had been waiting to try you for sooo long.",
            "This is a terrific restaurant on the coast just a few miles orth of Half Moon Bay. The chef makes every dish and every sauce from scratch and he even jubilantly grows his own peppers to season his dishes. Fish and vegetables come from local farms and fishermen. The presentation of the dishes is colorful and tasty. The restaurant is cavernous with both an upstairs dining area and a downstairs bar. Windows showcase the waves. We chose upstairs as it was quieter. Our favorite dish was the Tiradito de Scallops ($18) which is quickly seared in Tiradito sauce with avocado nori, and toasted quinoa. The Pulpo a la Parilla ($19) with purple potatoes is tasty and the entrée Aji de mariscos, ($28) a seafood medley in a tumeric sauce over jasmine rice had plenty of flavor. For dessert, we ordered the warm churros which comes with a hot chocolate dipping sauce. Our waiter was great. You can stand by a fire pit outside overlooking the ocean while enjoying a pisco sour. At night there is very little illumination outside and you may just pass it up. They need more lighting in the parking lot for sure. Definitely, recommend this restaurant while visiting the coast in Montara. Sister restaurants Barranco in Lafayette and Parada in Walnut Creek are also excellent.",
            "This is some of the best seafood restaurants I've been to. The salmon was as opposite of dry as you can get: very juicy and tasty. Even the dessert was remarkable.",
            "I went back to one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area to get a Pisco Sour. I love this drink! My husband likes Sangrias and my kids the fried chicken and Tequenios(Sorry for the mess we made, guys ). Our server Henry told us they are going to reopen the patio and we are more than happy to hear that. See you soon!",
            "Too fricking loud/expensive. Seating is one on top of another. Parking is horrid and in a potholed mud pit. Portions small for price. Food quality is good and service is satisfactory, but not great. Can't hear what server is saying. I was there at 7:30pm on a weekday, cannot imagine a weekend!!",
            "2017 culminated in a December of stuffing my face full of pricey delicious food, alcoholic beverages, and deciding to worry about the damage to my credit later.  YOLO!  Live your best life.  Nobody is guaranteed tomorrow.  Whatever, I don't need excuses, I'm an adult darn it!  La Costanera was one of the highlights of my eating binge and I hope to be back during the warmer months to take advantage of the patio.Gorgeous location, great staff, and a must experience destination in Half Moon Bay!My adult self, got surprised by husband bear with a scenic ride out to La Costanera.  We arrived just before opening and sunset.  We started with sizable happy hour bites and cocktails in the lower level lounge.  The pisco sour was garnished with extra holiday cheer (cinnamon) which was fantastic.  They also made a good martini for husband bear, but $18 for a martini was pretty steep, even for an upscale restaurant.  We got the beef heart skewers and the sausage and potato street food on happy hour as well.  Both were good enough to want to lick the plate clean--which I tried to accomplish using a fork.We then were able to get a prime dinner table right by the window for dinner service.  I have no idea how I managed to eat so much but let it be known that we then ordered two full sized entrees.  I got the Pescado a lo Macho (mahi mahi filet roasted over seafood stew, in a mild rocotopaprika sauce & served with coconut rice.)  Husband bear got the Seco de Cordero (lamb shank slow braised in cilantro-Cusquena beer, panamito beans & Jasmine rice).  Both were good, but I was definitely the winner.   Let me wax poetic about the savory, perfectly balanced, art of a sauce that covered perfectly cooked seafood.  This dish probably has origins that use the leftover bits of seafood, but not at La Costanera.  Choice parts of high quality seafood are swimming in the world's most delicious sauce.  I can't even describe how good this sauce is.  I think it wins best dish I had in 2017.  No joke.  And while I have had much more expensive and rare eats this year, I think this stew takes the cake.  Just the right balance of rustic and refined, I could eat this all day every day.  Never fear, there is enough stew that you can eat it at least twice! Just thinking about it makes me want it again.We managed to still get some dessert down the hatch.  We had a passion fruit panna cotta.  By the grace of god it was light and refreshing--otherwise they would have had to roll me out of the restaurant like Violet from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.",
            "This place is absolutely amazing!!! I came for lunch on a whim with my fiance and we fell in love with it so decided to have our wedding here. Eric is super organized and went above and beyond helping us to coordinate the wedding - it was very easy and absolutely seamless. So many guests commented on how delicious the food tasted - we had seafood stew, lamb, and chicken served family style and 3 desserts as well as several appetizers. Beautiful setting, even in December we were able to do the ceremony out on the patio and then had the reception indoors with a dance floor downstairs. Highly recommend this restaurant for dinner or for weddings or parties!",
            "Great food, great service, great location! Remember to make a reservation beforehand and book a table at a good spot for the sunset.",
            "Wow, really looking forward to some good seafood after all the hype.  The service was atrocious.  We ordered three things - scallops, shrimp dish, and the squash soup.  The soup was bland and poorly blended with stale nuts in it..., the shrimp sauce was incredibly plain and watered-down, with only three shrimp at $22.  The scallops, admittedly, were cooked properly and the best of a disappointing meal overall, but still not great.  We were initially served a salad instead of the soup we ordered, it took us at least 7 minutes to get any worker's attention to address the mistake....on an OVER-STAFFED FRIDAY NIGHT!!  (We were still charged for the soup.). My boyfriend said his favorite part of the meal was the Modelo he ordered...he doesn't even like beer.  Huge thumbs down.  Will never return.I went in there feeling rather content and left very unhappy.",
            "The food here was excellent. I had the cerviche and empanada as my meal. Both were delicious. We also ordered the chicken chicharrones and calamari chicharrones. Perfectly seasoned and cooked perfectly. My friend had the Shrimp which had the most yummy garlic bread. Let's now talk about the breathtaking view of Half Moon Bay. From the main dining area, you get a spectacular view. Service was excellent. I don't give many restaurants five stars but this was definitely worthy of it for 1) overall experience 2) ambiance 3) food and 4) service. All were top notch the night I was there. Pricey but to be expected. I would highly recommend for a romantic spot and try to schedule around the sun setting. So beautiful. And don't forget your camera."

The mix of beer and frozen margarita isn't too boozy and good with a squeeze of lime.The carne asada burrito is delicious and filling after running around the beach and hiking the trails in Mt Tam. They have a couple salsas and pickled vegetables laid out to add to your food too. The carne asada fries is just what it sounds like - fries, marinated beef and cheese. Much simpler than what you'd find in San Diego but still really good hot out of the fryer. I'll be back on a warmer day for one of their shakes!",
            "The best place in Stinson, located under the lifeguard tower in Stinson.

            "Stinson Beach better be super stoked that this place exists! Not only is the space and concept beautifully beachy but, the food and drink menu is killer too! With limited options in the small town, The Siren Canteen is easily my favorite lunch spot. Mexican food, American standards and a concise drink menu make this place a must stop for any beachgoer. Heck, if you're passing through Stinson during open hours, I'd say make a stop too! My fam and I ordered a bunch of different \"street\" tacos, the carne asada nachos and some of the delicious beer floats for lunch and it was all delicious! The place was packed but, it didn't stop the speedy service. In fact, the owner was there with her sleeves rolled up and clearing tables...what a veteran move and I LOVE meeting the owners. Check this place out as it's one of two spots that are a must see/stop in Stinson.",

We paid about $31 (including tip, mind you) for a very delicious vegetable quesadilla (with the added mushrooms), an ABC Burger (avocado, bacon and cheese), the tastiest sweet potato fries either of us have ever had, a bottled water and a frothy latte-like coffee. We're coming back for more of the same--and we've been here before. Both visits: awesome. Yelpers, bring your appetites and your beach towels.",
            "This is the cutest, most precious place! My friend and I came here as first-timers and we were smitten by the vibe, location, and friendly staff. You get a great view of the ocean and feel like you discovered a little secret. This was my first time at Stinson Beach, and I instantly fell in love with the small town charm.We both ordered a burger with sweet potato fries before our hike. We felt fueled and ready to go after our meal! They advertise that they use grass-fed beef, which is always a plus in my book, and you can definitely taste the difference. They have pickled jalapenos and onions that you can try at your leisure so i piled those little babies onto my burger for extra flavor.  I devoured it! If you are in the area, I definitely recommend this cute little gem.",
            "I would give this place 10 stars if I could.The food was good, but really the setting was right out of a movie set, and we (without planning timed it perfectly).They close at 5pm in Dec. we got there around 20 mins to 5. Ordered a burger with ranch dressing avocado and cheese and some steak fries. (someone else order the quesadilla - which really did look good).We immediately got one of the tables right by the window and watched an amazing sunset over the ocean.  I don't think if we had tried to make this happen we could have done it. Obviously this place must be packed in the summer and fall, and the sun sets later then, so not sure you could make this magic happen again.Puff puff, heart heart!!!",

            "A sophisticated beach shack slinging high-end tacos, burritos, and quesadillas (and a few burgers). They have beer and wine on draft and I pretty much squealed like a girl at a boy band concert when I saw that they offered a Beer Float. Basically like a shandy but instead of lemonade and beer, it's a frozen margarita floater with a nice cold beer. They have indoor and outdoor seating and it can get crowded at lunch time, but it didn't look like anyone had trouble finding a seat. Love their pickled vegetable and salsa selection. Definitely jazzed up the Mexican fare.The guac was a little disappointing, but the homemade chips were perfect, so don't skip those. My pulled pork taco wasn't the best (they don't have pulled pork all the time), but it was sizable and luckily my uncle got a carne asada quesadilla and gave me a couple slices. Definitely a stand out and I appreciated the ratio of cheese to meat!Bonus: they have milkshakes, too!",
            "HAVE AGAIN: The Siren Burger was very good and just the right size (not too much meat). The Meyer lemon shake was also very good. Next time try to nachos and chocolate milk shake. Great location and worth the 15 minute wait in line. Friendly people!",
            "What do you do after you've finished a 7 mile hike? Walk over to Siren Canteen for some lunch and a milkshake! You totally deserve all of the things!I ordered a shrimp and pulled pork taco plus a root beer milkshake. To be honest, I inhaled the tacos. I was super hungry and the only thing keeping me from giving this place five stars is the fact that my shrimp was overcooked. The milkshake was recommended, and it was the perfect, creamy root beer float flavor. Definitely hit the spot. I got my food quickly and at 12:30 in the afternoon it wasn't crowded. The open space environment along with being located beach side makes this the perfect place to relax after a hike!I will definitely be back to try more of the things on the menu, maybe grab a blanket and a book to chill on the beach next time too!",

I tried the \"Siren Burger\" for the first time and it gets a huge thumbs up!It was cooked just right and it met my personal \"burger rating\" of 5 napkins.  What I like about the hamburger is the thin bun.  It was super tasty and I topped it off with the creamy \"lemon milkshake\".  Mary, the owner is very personable, sweet and cute as hell. She has a friendly young staff that makes you feel right at home.  I only wish that this \"canteen\" was closer to my home.  I would end up eating here every day!",

This year was an exception due to National Park shut down (Thanks to Trump politics).  We'll celebrate the 2020 new year and the replacement presidency here.",
            "One of the great California on the beach places (on Stinson Beach along the Sonoma Coast).  If you are traveling up the coast past SF, this is a must stop.  Fantastic mexican food right on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.  acmefoodwine.com",
            "There are few things more satisfying after a 16.7 mile hike than a cold milkshake and some tacos. I had a few fish tacos, shared some nachos, and had an order of the sweet potato fries. Each taco feels a bit expansive at $4.50 each, but the tacos are definitely filling. My fish tacos were topped with so many different garnishes, it was actually a bit hard to hold. My only other criticism with the taco was I wish the fish was a little bit crispier. Under all the slaw, the fish coating tasted just a tiny bit soggy. The nachos are made from their store-made tortilla chips and are fantastic. They hold up extremely well to the large spoonful of guac and sour cream on the nachos. I forgot how much the base nachos are, but you should get those over the ones that include meat; I don't think it's worth the extra cost. Lastly, even if you're not a fan of sweet potato fries, I'd say you should give it a shot at Siren Canteen. The fries here are easily some of the best I've had. Make sure you stop by early in the day if possible. When I arrived near closing, they were out of the al pastor :(",
            "Love this place it's so conveniently located and I really appreciate the margaritas. Relax on the beach enjoy the day and have a margarita with a carne asada nachos. Soooo Good! I visit this place every time I come here staff is cool and it has an overall good vibe. Recommend and will always return.",
            "Always enjoy eating here. Pet friendly as well as kid friendly too. Good tasting malts. The view of the ocean, with an occasional whale, if your lucky,  your delicious burger....what more can you ask for."

            "A must eat if you are looking to try authentic Himalayan food! Monsoon is family owned by a friendly family from Nepal. I have been here twice now, but on our most recent visit this past weekend we ordered: vegetable momo, chicken momo, vegetable fried rice, paneer tikka masala, chicken palak, chicken tandoori, plain naan and some orders of brown and white rice.Everything was made to order and came out quickly and at the same time. Both the chicken and vegetable momos were delicious, especially with the homemade sauce! I typically enjoy vegetarian curries so paneer dishes are my usual go-to's. The paneer tikka masala was great! Liked that it was more seasoned and tasty than other places I've had it at. The naan was crispy and light. Paired great with all the dishes we got. Beer and wine options are plenty and most, if not all, are locally sourced from Bay Area breweries - Hermitage Brewing being one of the most abundant options on their menu. Clean restaurant. Well decorated, Plenty of seating. Friendly service!Will definitely be back again sometime soon. Monsoon is situated in a small strip mall right at the corner of 92 and 1 - super accessible for weary travelers. Stop by after a day exploring HMB or to take a break from driving Hwy 1. Monsoon's dishes will keep your belly warm after enjoying the (cold) beaches here. :)",
            "This is one of half moon bay's Asian subcontinent restaurants  which while having it's charms is not without some flaws.Parking is usually available in the surface lot associated with the strip mall this place is located in. While that can be massively busy -some of the nearby business are very popular as is the park associated with the lot-there will be a space available somewhere if not right in front. The decor and overall theme is quite charming. The seating is arranged in a sort of circular pattern around the center of the space which is set up as a kind of decorative shrine. It's not a real shrine mind you just a leftover from whatever was here before richly decorated. The seating is the standard table/chair combos but they are clean,new, and match the overall decor nicely. Overall the effect of the decor improves the overall feel. Service can be hit and miss. I've had excellent service once, indifferent service once and absolutely terrible service once, so it's hard to say what will happen next time. I've actually seen a waiter ask a couple to leave because they wanted to sit up front instead of by the restroom. Even though there were only two other people in the restaurant it seems he was unwilling to compromise on giving a four place table to two people. You know just in case hundreds of people showed up needing a four spot at five pm on a Monday. It's good to see a man who believes in standing on principle no matter what except of course it really isn't. Aside from that however the service was good on all our visits. The food is interesting. It's not really traditional Indian style cuisine. I suspect that it's not all that traditional Himalayan either, but to be fair I'm not a renowned Himalayan food scholar. I do note that on our last visit they didn't have momo. I mean they were on the menu but not available from the kitchen for some reason. So we had the thali instead which of course is not on the menu but was the daily special. A thali is a sort of sampling platter of six or so different things. It can be quite the taste experience as the intent is to offer a mixture of flavors textures and colors. Creamy, salty, sweet and spicy should all be represented in small stainless steel cups. Small portions but a lot of variety. Unfortunately this was something of a miss as it ran long on sweet or bland flavors. The time before that we chose paneer tikka and veg korma. Same story-the tikka was sweet the korma unremarkable. Pricing is standard for the area. Roughly twenty dollars a plate or slightly more depending on choices made.Overall it's not a bad choice especially if you are not a fan of the overspiced food which can be common at some East Indian styled places.  But it may not be richly textured and complex food either.",
            "Very Much enjoyed our lunch at Monsoon where China meets India with excellent Himalayan food. The food was  excellent with  good portions.Chill chicken for appetizers and Vegetable Samosa. The chilli chicken was enough for a meal. We also had the Tandoori chicken, vegetable biryani and the mixed vegetable curry . All the dishes are  awesome and you wont go hungry.",
            "They gave us a complimentary appetizer. The ambiance is so on point and the portions were soooo generous!",
            "Came here for lunch:I had the:*Vegetable Samosa - good.  Their chutneys were good*Chicken Momo - honestly, it tasted like regular Chinese dumplings.  They probably put a little turmeric to give it a yellow tinge but you don't really taste it. *Garlic Naan - delicious.  Very flavorful. *Paneer Tikka Masala - delicious.  The place was decorated nicely. In terms of service, the waitress was really nice. Only problem was I caught her picking her nose right before she went to grab our food from the kitchen.  She didn't wash her hands.  Honestly, I try not to think about it.TL;DR:  food is good! The Momo is basically Chinese potstickers.  The waitress should try to not pick her nose.",
            "First impression is \"this place is soooo clean!\" Napkins, tables tops and furnitures are extremely clean! No dust on any counter surface. Love it. We ordered vegetable samosas and Himalayan chicken (spicy) with brown rice and Garlic nan. My tolerance for spicy food is pretty high. And the levelOf spicy here is really spicy. So I recommend you to try with caution. In other words if you love spicy food, ordering spicy is the way to go. Garlic nan is the best I have ever had, no exaggeration. Fresh garlic with crispy texture. We had two people share the above and that was just enough for us.",
            "This is an amazing restaurant!!! Food was delicious!! Customer service was superb!!! I will drive to Halfmoon Bay to eat here again!!!",
            "Himalayan and Half Moon Bay doesn't sound like they go together, more like the title of an undiscovered Tennessee Williams play where a repressed Southern spinster finds passion with a yogi in an ashram. But who am I kidding? Himalayan/Nepalese restaurants are popping up everywhere, and who doesn't love a warm momo? Especially eight of them on a plate with a ramekin of tomato chutney. But alas, those carb-heavy meals are few and far between, dammit.Luckily, there were other options including a sizable vegetarian section in this atmospheric spot embedded in a strip mall at the beginning of Main Street. I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious it was, but I was in the 'burbs after all. I decided to go full gonzo and ordered the $16 Vegetarian Combination Meal which delivered a Whitman's sampler of a half-dozen items on a rustic hammered tray. Gorgeous presentation (photo: bit.ly/2M5PzrE). And genuinely delicious.It was dominated by a spinach curry topped with tomato wedges and a creamy drizzle, as well as a mixed vegetable curry of potatoes, cauliflower, and tomatoes. There was also dal soup with the same cream, brown rice, a side salad with a sweet housemade dressing, and as a sweet treat, a bit of kheer or Indian rice pudding. Nice to know you can order more than clam chowder around these parts. Himalayan and Half Moon Bay do go together, and you don't have to depend on the kindness of strangers.FOOD - 4 stars...a nice, filling veggie meal that even a Buddhist monk can gorgeAMBIANCE - 4 stars...decorated to the hilt like a Himalayan HyattSERVICE - 4 stars...very cordial and pretty quickTOTAL - 4 stars...Nepalese nirvana on the coastRELATED - Collection of Indian and Nepalese eateries I've tried and reviewed: bit.ly/2v4hsdd",
            "The space itself is calming. I entered the space and felt the intention and the attention that the owner has put into the space. I instantly felt welcomed. I ordered a vegetarian combo and the meal was heart opening. The soup is delicate and I can taste the various Himalayan ingredients. They have Himalayan salt for every table, which has more health benefit. The spinach curry is So creamy that it melts my heart. And the rice pudding just draws a perfect period to my meal relishing healing session.",
            "It's a great place that appears to be a family run restaurant. I really liked the decor, but most of all the food was really excellent.",
            "This is a nice locally owned restaurant that has some pretty good food. Overall the cost is very serviceable and the dishes are nice. I'm giving it for Starz although it's somewhere around three and a half but I think you get a little bit more because the cost when you leave is actually very reasonable and the service was very friendly and the people really cared about whether or not you enjoy their food",
            "I love the Resturant decoration! Very friendly service! Amazing food! Everything we ordered was great! Similar to Indian food but 100% better the spice is just right not overwhelming!!",
            "My wife and I had a very enjoyable dinner here on a recent Saturday night--after dealing with the nasty traffic on highway 92 in order to get here.  Fortunately a very welcoming and relaxing atmosphere greets you when you arrive.Here what we had:Mixed Vegetable Curry  4/5.   Fresh mixed vegetables with a curry sauce.  The veggies were cooked just right and the \"medium\" spice was pretty mild.Vegetable Korma: 4/5.   Fresh mixed vegetables cooked in a creamy and nutty curry sauce.  The traffic on 92 was heavier than Google maps predicted and we got here a little late--and we had plans to see a show at 7 in HMB.  We mentioned this to our waitress and she was great in getting our order in quickly so that we could have a more leisurely dinner.  That we very much appreciated.",
            "Perfect food! Amazing hosts!! This is hole in a wall india food. Very nice people and equally nice atmosphere and food.",

            "Service was excellent across the board. This authentic Nepalese restaurant was definitely on point! We were welcome in by a sweet little lady who sat us down. This is a family owned restaurant and it definitely gave a feel of family sharing and hospitality.All the food was delicious, from the vegetable somosa to the lamb dish. My husband and I opted to share our meal rather than get individual plates and it worked out just fine. Somosa was the appetizer. Lamb vindaloo was the entree. We also enjoyed garlic naan. There was no excess salt nor lack thereof. We chose mild for everything as I'm not a fan of excess spicy-hot. It was perfect!We will definitely return when we're back in the area. Definitely 5* for us!",
            "Chicken chow mein is so flavorful and delicious. Menu is priced well. Can't wait to go back!",
            "We very much enjoyed our meal.  A little limited in choices if you are vegetarian or vegan but still lovely and all was cooked very well.And the staff was truly lovely, smiley and kind and receptive to answering questions.We will return.",
            "Outstanding! First time having Himalayan cuisine. It's almost like a fusion of Indian and Thai flavors. I highly recommend the chow mein and the butter chicken is delicious. My husband isn't the most adventurous eater and he loves everything. The restaurant itself is warm and inviting considering it's in a strip mall. The staff was very sweet and attentive. Our family will definitely be heading back to try more menu items."

(Apparently, their corn they grind for the masa comes from Oaxaca #endNAFTA)I also ordered one of their cemitas.  The fried chicken cemita was crusp and delicious, and I had to go back to try their pastor cemita.  Fire Definitely worth the sto",
            "Great location right next to the ocean in Davenport.  This spot has tacos and cemitas with some really good pricing.  The restaurant is not very large but does have a patio with outdoor seating.  They had some live music playing but the overall quality of the artists was pretty sub par with two older gentlemen being the cast and crew.Enough with the bad news...the food itself is really tasty and well thought out.  The tacos are fresh and the ingredients are definitely the same.  They are cooked to order and you can tell they aren't sitting under some hot plate.  Definitely would recommend giving this place a shot!",
            "Very authentic Mexican food!!We tried queso fundido, street corn, guac and chips and salsa and chips as appetizers. They were all very good, specially the corn. Most of us had tacos al Pastor on corn tortillas. They were really yummy. They make their corn tortillas daily from Oaxacan corn. The al pastor Meet was very tasty. We also had Puebla Hot Chicken, Rajas and Beef Milanesa Cemitas (Sandwiches). Our teenagers liked them very much. The Rajas was a little hot for our wimpy kid...Great stop on our drive on Hwy 1!!",
            "They sell tacos and \"Cemiches\" - sandwiches. We had Al Pastor tacos and Pescado (fish- cod, I believe) tacos. $8 for two small fish tacos. $7 for two small AlPastor. Reasonable. They have beer and wine. Cute ambiance in what used to be the Davenport cafe that I never ate at. Good first experience. Wish they would put burritos on the menu. They also have breakfast sandwiches until 2 pm. The special today was Pozole. Food quality definitely very good. Will be back to try those Cemiches. They have free WiFi also which is nice bc Davenport has shitty cell service.",
            "Unless you're in the area, passing by, or making a special trip, it's easy to miss Cemitas in Davenport. There's only a few businesses at this small stop off H1. Not far, but far enough from central Santa Cruz, it only came on my radar because I was looking for something new and different from the same old food in SC.Menu has a nice spread of tacos with handmade tortillas, Cemitas - Pueblan sandwiches - which I had never heard of before coming, and small dishes.The Pescado Taco was great - well made, fresh ingredients. We also got the Pueblan Hot Chicken Cemita to share. Alright, but a tad dry and would've benefitted from a little more cream. Also, the photos others posted led us to think the chicken was thicker. However, it's very thin, adding to the dryness.I'd like to come back and try the Al Pastor taco and Esquites others raved about.",
            "We had a delicious lunch here: chicken tacos and al pastor sandwich. The tortillas were handmade on site and there was a lot of meat in them which had a really nice flavor...not just your standard tacos. The sandwich was large and had bits of grilled pineapple and pickled onion. Even though it was a fairly chilly day, we sat on the patio because we had our dogs with us. Will definitely stop in again the next time we're in Davenport.",
            "Place is really good!  Chicken tacos had incredible Flavor ; beans were really good as well. Fresh made corn tortillas ; fantastic.  Some one know what the heck they are doing back there! Ambiance and ocean view doesn't hurt either.",
            "This spot is easy to miss but if you follow your nose and your love for street tacos, you'll be sure to find it. I got the fish tacos with handmade tortillas. These fish tacos are the best I've had in the Bay Area! So delicious I still dream about it to this day.. drools",
            "Stopped in here merely by chance last Sunday while touring the bluffs. It's not a large place, but the taste of the food is large. Ordered the Al Pastor tacos along with a side of Guacomole and chips, and an adult beverage to compliment the meal. Tacos were on homemade shells and simply burst with flavor. I'm not a seafood guy, so these really hit the spotThe Guacomole is made fresh onsite and can truly be a meal in itself. I didn't realize the appetizer would have such a big portion. Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but I was rather full by the time I left.The people working here were also great. Very friendly and even asked my opinion on whether the Guac needed anything added. Small patio on the side offers outside seating for a few folks if weather permits.",
            "Over the top - never tasted Mexican food like this before. Super nice people and the food was incredible. The guacamole is nothing like you've ever had before with a sprinkling of seeds (pepitas I think or maybe they were sunflower), thin little shoestring watermelon radish and a sprinkle of sea salt. The red sauce was so good I could have just drank it as a beverage. I had the al pastor sandwich (masterpiece) and my husband had the Puebla hot chicken sandwich (ditto masterpiece). You just have to go no matter how far away you live in the Santa Cruz area - it's so worth it and a beautiful ocean front drive getting there!!!",
            "Don't sleep on this place!!! Handmade tortillas, Mexican Street Corn, upscale tacos, coastal views and food vibes!This is a much needed upgrade to Davenport. Do yourself a favor and EAT here!!!!I drive all the way from Los Gatos to experience this amazing food!",
            "The salsas (red/green) that come with chips/salsa order are yummy!!!! They have delicious and distinct taste. I judge a Méxican restaurant by their salsa-so yes! Tacos: I custom ordered a poblano pepper taco order and added al pastor. SO SO GOOD. The sándwich: we were excited to try it. The chicken was a bit on the drier side. It could've used more spread. Something was missing to make it tasty-that's why I'm going with 4 vs 5 stars. The menu is small so with specialty items, I feel they should be perfected. Street Corn: THE BEST! So so good. The overall experience was great. Indoor space can use some work but outdoor had true mexican vibes. Loved it. The staff was also very nice.",
            "Cemitas 1 is my new favorite hot spot. I literally dream about the Mexican street corn that they import from Oaxaca Mexico. All tortillas are handmade to make the perfect tacos. My go to: fish tacos and queso fundido con chorizo . Although you can't go wrong on this menu. The restaurant is right off the 1 with ocean views. Breathtaking sunsets make the perfect dining experience for a casual evening or after a surf. Davenport just upgraded with this new taqueria .I think(know) these tacos are my new weekly ritual. tacos.sunset.adventure.repeat.",

            "Stopped in on a whim. Good Mexican food. Ordered fish tacos. Great corn tortillas. Fish needed seasoning. Chips and salsa really good. The red salsa is smoky green salsa tangy. Worth a stop.",
            "What a great destination along Highway 1! They're not your typical taqueria. They've got a fairly specific menu - three different types of tacos, four varieties of sandwiches and a nice selection of sides that are great to share. I loved the rajas poblano tacos. It's something you don't see just anywhere. They roasted poblanos and onion and topped it with avocado and cotija cheese. The tortillas are made to order and it shows. They're fresh and warm and hold together on their own.Also good are the frijoles charros beans (served in a skillet) and the guacamole. The beans come with three of those great tortillas. I got both sides and made my own bean/guacamole tacos with what I was given. Then I scooped up what was left with chips.Also fun food to play with - the queso fundido. It's bubbling cheese in a skillet topped with a little grilled poblanos and onions. Served with more of those tortillas, you can make your own melted cheese tacos.The cemitas look great. They're served hot and all have Oaxcan cheese that looks a lot like string cheese. They're very unique - again, not something you're going to find in most Mexican restaurants. They're stacked high with layers of meat, avocado, pickled onions, and cheese.They've got outdoor seating on a side patio and views of the ocean from across the highway. They serve beer and wine. Fun place!",
            "Pretty good little restaurant, I had the carnitas tacos, which were tasty and a tad preciously presented with a single cilantro leaf atop each one, and the street corn, which was delicious, but also wasn't quite what I was expecting. It was served cut up in a bowl instead of on the cob, which doesn't feel especially street-like. A small quibble. Still a totally good dinner after a long drive across 92 and down Highway 1. Chill staff. Free Wi-Fi.",
            "We had completed a bike ride on Gazos Creek Rd., and we decided to stop at Cemitas for lunch on the way home. GREAT decision! We started with chips and guacamole + salsa. Very delicious. The guacamole was fresh, topped with spiced pepitos and shred of radish. The two accompanying salsas were wonderful, not too spicy and very tasty. We each had a salad with added avocado, my husband also added the crispy beef. And finally we split an order of Al Pastor tacos with the pork. Wonderful flavors, and the tortillas are homemade. We will go back for sure, this was a wonderful find!",
            "Well that was phenomenal!, probably the best guacamole I've ever had and both the fish and pork tacos were awesome. Definitely be back."

Fantastic views of the ocean but if I may recommend some barista training. The latte was like an americano with hot milk (no micro froth). Guys at that price it had better be better than what I can make on my Breville at home. I would suggest looking at your grinder (needs to be finer for espresso), increased arm pressure after grind on the cup before steaming, and make sure you have at least 11-14 BAR (should be min 14+ on a professional machine or it needs a service). Then you gotta have micro steamed milk or it's a cafe ole not latte. Did I work at Starbucks. No, YouTube! Also here's some suggestions photos (full disclaimer these photos are NOT Ebbtide Cafe but should be) and a high bar to reach (not pun intended). Will come back in a few months because the place is so cool but coffee didn't do it for me all sadly especially at that price or BYOC.Haha - someone complained about the latte examples that I posted and were removed by yelp. What a joke. Anyway it's all on YouTube on how to make a good latte but my latte photos were epic if you missed them.",

We dropped by on a vacation, had a breakfast snack and coffee, enjoyed the sunrise and then walked on the beach.

            "We had a very disappointing experience with the rude employees of this cafe. Arrived at 4:57, 2 minutes after our friends who have just placed an order. A minute later the barista refused to take our order caliming they are closed. They were still making our friends order (so espresso machine still hot and nithing cleaned or shut) but would not add ours, not even hot chocolate for the kids. We will not return. By the way, closing hour on their website and Yelp page was 6:00 pm!",
            "Absolutely adorable little coffee shop tucked out of the way close to Half Moon Bay in the lesser-traveled Miramar. When Half Moon Bay is hustling and bustling, venture a few miles down the road to this gem. Lovely cafe with deck seating and some picnic tables off the deck where you can sit with your pooch (no dogs on deck itself). Coffee and espresso drinks are excellent, and you can't beat the views of the ocean across the street. Parking is easy in the surrounding streets. Cash only. No wifi (but who needs it?)",
            "Excellent Cappuccino . Beautiful ocean bay view. Croissant was delicious. Cash only place. Family friendly.",
            "The only good thing about this little cafe is the view. We waited 45 minutes for a bagel with cream cheese and when we got it it was wrong so they had to take it back and so we had to wait some more.  We kept telling us that this is California (we were visiting from NY) but waiting 45 minutes for a simple bagel with cream cheese is not acceptable by any standard. And when we asked about our order the waiter said \"patience is a virtue!\" Amazing. I was blown away by the customer service at this place."

            "I drove over to the coast to escape the horrible East Bay air during the Camp fire tragedy. I was going to make a quick stop at the outstanding San Benito deli in Half Moon Bay, which is a small but mighty portion of the whole San Benito establishment. The main restaurant had recently changed hands with a new Mexican theme, so decided to give it a try.Wow! Thanks to the Margaritas served up by the Cantina bar, our group ended making a bit of an afternoon of it (I had a classic lime and then the chipotle versions - both were excellent & potent. It was a sunny day so we were able to enjoy the well-landscaped & spacious patio (where they often have live music). The flavors of the dishes were more than solid. My faves were the exceptional BBQ wings from their hardwood smoker and the fried calamari taco; we also sampled the quesadilla, pozole, salmon taco, and nachos - all muy sabroso!Nice bar, two sports screen, fireplace in the patio, big outdoor event space behind the patio. The friendly owner, Chris gave us a tour of the historic guest rooms upstairs he's slowly remodeling. All around, a find. Of course I couldn't leave without getting my deli sandwich to go.",
            "Unexpected find in downtown Half Moon view. The restaurant is a seat your self place with cantina food. Came her with a friend and we found the food to be really good and reasonably priced. The service was a little slow, but there wasn't tons of staff, plus it is a bar. The salsa and guacamole was really good! Quesadilla - nice and crispy, good cheese balance. Vegetarian street tacos were good, not a ton going on but they were good (comes with corn, cheese, black beans and cabbage). Chicken street tacos were good (chicken, onion and cilantro). The strawberry margarita was awesome, nice tamarind rim.",
            "Holy cow, ya'all! Or chicken, in this case! Delicious, buttermilk marinated fried chicken breast sandwich that had a new flavor in every bite! And nachos drenched in white chicken chili, housemade guacamole and roasted corn. Yum! Te Elote Con Queso. Corn lollipops slathered in creamy aioli, cotija cheese and chili powder, was a great starter too. The strawberry margarita was tasty and strong and the Elysia Star Dust made the whole meal complete. In the heart of Half Moon Bay, this cantina is a throwback to another era and you could feel the community from the bar full of familiars to the fast and efficient bartenders to the locals and tourists mingling. Couldn't recommend this place more!",
            "I didn't want to give a review to this place because, expect for the locals, it's one of the best kept secrets in HMB; but people have started to find it. It's in a very beautiful location and has a really nice decoration which makes you feel good as soon as you walk in. All the bartenders are really nice and even when the place gets busy they make an effort to prepare your drinks. We've been here a few times and have ordered their salmon tacos and chicken wings which are delicious! They also let you buy food from the Deli next door which you can bring and eat at the bar! Their selection of beer can satisfy everyone! This place is outstanding!"

You can order dinner off the regular menu or pub menu. The burger is so yummy. The service is great as well. Be sure to make a reservation. The only issue I have with this place is that it's really dark, a bit too dark for me. But not a huge deal if the food is tasty...which it definitely is!",
            "I came to the Village Pub at the end of January with my supervisor after visiting the Apple Park and was pleasantly surprised, although for two people it easily came up to $500 with half a bottle of wine, two main courses, one appetizer, and one dessert.I really enjoyed the bone-in ribeye there, which was tender and flavorful. It was rich in texture but not overpowering. Oh, and don't forget to add on the foie gras supplement! The Baked Alaska dessert we had looked very nice, but was slightly disappointing as I thought it was overly burnt and had too much of a woody smell to the ice cream.  What I most enjoyed was the old-American style classiness in its decor. The interior had a uniform reddish hue theme, with red bricks, high wooden plank ceilings, dimmed lighting, and traditional white table cloth. Most people were older and well-dressed. The whole scene struck me as quite elegant. Village Pub is located in Woodside, which is about 20 mins away from Palo Alto. I really liked how the restaurant is located by itself in a semi-secluded area. The moment you walk out of the restaurant, you are met with some very fresh air, and a sky full of stars. I don't think there is a lot in the area, but it seems like there are some residential community nearby and some small shops. If I had the chance, I might try a little walk around the area and then come for a great night cap.",
            "We came here for our anniversary celebration. I was amazed that my hubby picked out a great restaurant. The food was A+ including the service. Luckily we had reservation because the restaurant was packed for a Saturday night. The have one of the best wine lists. I told the waitress to surprise me with some fruity cocktails. I was happy with my drink.Parking is little hard but get there early to secure a spot. Parking is free though. The chef gave us some complimentary cookies to take home. Definitely, we're going back.",
            "8/9/18Old skool as hell.  Oh, no, I don't mean me... yeah it was my bday, but my gf was treating so why not another Michelin Star restaurant right?So, walking in I was immediately struck by its classic elegance, made even more obvious by the fact that everyone else was wearing suits and nice dresses.  Come here in a t-shirt or shorts you'd really deserve to be tarred and feathered!  Don't even think it.  Can you believe when we went to 3-star $300/person Benu there were actually 2 men at the table next to us wearing just that?--tshirts and shorts???  Amazing.  Complete with frowns too.No, come here in your bestest clothes.  Trust me.  A full suit would not look out of place.  It's that kind of restaurant.  Some grey hair would make you fit in even more.So, given all that, you'd think that Michelin Star, starched shirts and all, you'd think the experience would be exemplary right?  Not.  I mean, let's start with the dining tables--the tables for 2 have round bases that cover the entire footprint of the floor so I couldn't rest my feet flat, and after an hour or two of sitting, my legs started painful but eventually became numb.  Seriously not acceptable.And there were other mishaps...1. Greyhound's Tooth $15 \"benedictine, vodka, grapefruit, lemon, grapefruit bitters\":  A nice blend of tanginess and bitterness.  Well balanced and the vodka was not at all harsh.  6/101.5. Cheese Puffs Amuse Bouche:  Not bad.  Good cheese flavor, but not all that special.  Appreciate the thought though.  5/102. Sonoma Valley Foie Gras Terrine $27 \"local blackberries / caramlized corn flakes\":  Well, foie gras ain't my gf's thing.  Dunno why.  She can damn cook that stuff though!--we've purchased lobes before to make at our dinner parties, and god is it so much cheaper than at restaurants!  Sure, it's $100-150/package, but really there must be 20x as much as what I saw on my plate here!  Maybe more, honestly.  Anyway, stingy portions aside, the plating was gorgeous!, but I think they went over the top with the colorful sweets cause it made this taste more like dessert than an appetizer.  My gf loved the ultra charred top and bottom curst though.  I was thinking that if only they had a bowl of milk--you could make breakfast cereal from this!  5/10...sooo... that foie gras was kinda messy and left flakes on the table.  The waiter cleared the dishes as he should for the next course, but left the whole table with flakes on it.  Hmmmm....3. Persian Cucumber and Melon Salad $17 \"oil-cured olives / feta cheese\":  Basically a fruit salad with some thin slices of cucumber.  I did like the fruit sauce though.  6/104. Butter Poached Lobster $65 \"with sweet corn and chantrelle\" (special):  Alright, GET THIS... the first (yes, 1st as in there will be a 2nd) attempt featured ravioli with RAW edges.  Raw and hard dough???, eww.... and the lobster was tiny and seriously way over cooked.  Like the baked lobster at Red Lobster's juicier!  The sauce was damn delicious though.  The waitress did come by and ask how we liked it... so I politely told her it SUCKED HELL, and she graciously took it back....the 2nd attempt was a bit better, but the ravioli still had those slightly raw and hard edges.  I dunno if they are over-air drying these or what, but please stop it!  The flavor was awesome at least.  Lobster was more edible, but still not good.  4/105. Grilled Coleman Pork Loin $40 \"pearl barley / k&j apricots\":  It was cooked properly medium rare, but somehow remained strangely tough.  Not stringy tough, but hard.  The sauce again was very flavorful with great texture.  But the tough and bland pork just was amateur.  4/10...alright get this, they give you these ornate knives for cutting the meat--great.  But, they are dull as all hell!  I swear they haven't been sharpened in like...... well, since opening.  Butter knives would be sharper!  Things like this suggest that Michelin Star is not warranted.6. Chocolate Souffle $18 \"grand marnier creme anglaise\":  Definitely a chocolate lover's souffle.  Very airy, with ultra strong chocolate flavor, like cocoa turned into air mixed with cream!  It was a bit too strong for me though, and I couldn't take more than a couple bites.  8/107. Ethiopia, Aricha Coffee Service $8 \"cherry / butter cream / vanilla extract\":  I thought it was well rounded with just the right amount of bitterness for me.  Has a more complex taste compared to normal-folk coffee... (jk jk).  I liked the lingering taste on the tongue.  8/10In conclusion, yes, generally the food is okay.  However, none of the dishes we had were 9 or a perfect 10.  And the lame tables, the useless knives, craptastic lobster... seriously, what are you thinking Michelin???(Btw, I forgot to mention, their bourbon/whiskey list is quite impressive.  Maybe if we come back for a second chance...)3/5#michelinstar #woodside #paloalto #menlopark #redwoodcity #americanfood #pub #whiskey #whisky",
            "Had lunch Friday with my son in law. Very quiet. Labor Day weekend evident as many open tables. Great place for lunch. I'd forgotten how pleasant it is to actually speak to someone in a restaurant and actually be able to hear them without straining. I've added some pictures and the current menu. Look this place is excellent.  It's very expensive, embarrassing actually. Had I remembered I would likely have gone to Madera. I appreciate value as much as good food. No reason why you can't have both. I had an excellent lunch omelette, my son in law, a pasta. 2 small salads, some white wine. Lunch, tax and tip, $175. You decide. Of course, as the majority of the diners appear to be Silicon Valley VCs and PE Partners no wonder. I bet they even sell a bottle or two of DRC at $16,000.Bottom line-- fine establishment -- bring your Platinum Card.",
            "Amazing food and service. A little hard to find, so squeeze in some extra time to find the place and parking. I believe this place deserves more than 1 Michelin star. With that being said, you get your money worth here; it is not overprice or over hyped. Atmosphere: dimmed lighting, quite noise level, and semi-casual attire. Hence, if your planing on a pub setting, this is not place. The name of the restaurant may be misleading.",
            "Food and services are amazing. I took my little sister here to celebrate a job promotion and I was glad that I choose this restaurant. We didn't have a reservation and was seated by  the bar. The place was beautiful and I absolutely love their comfy red velvet sofas. Parking is free in the back so drive around the building. Food was excellent. I enjoyed the curry flavor on the duck breast. The steak was perfectly cooked and very tender. I did like their foie gras mousse. I was hoping for an actual piece of foie gras. We ordered a chocolate soufflé for dessert which was so good. Chef gave us complimentary cookies and mini cakes to take home. I look forward to coming back in the future.",
            "There's a high value to be given to a Michelin rated meal available relatively close to multiple cities, that doesn't require a booking in advance. This brings a sense of ease and attainability to this restaurant that is very welcome for any fine dining. The mood is very much that of a classic fine dining experience - the male host is unnecessarily stiff and robotic, the hostesses friendly and smiley.  You feel out of place with the mixture of clientele, which is something this restaurant cannot control, as a majority of people seem like old-tech money but the lighting and setting is somehow romantic. It's all confusing but still very nice and I don't factor that into my review. As for the meal, let's first talk about drinks. For such an average sized venue, they have an insanely deep wine selection. The wine selection here is extremely impressive, besides having staples and crowd favorites, more impressively selected international offerings. Even if you don't drink wine, their Somm's are extremely friendly and chatty, guiding you in the right direction for your meal. It was a delight to have them.It was odd that the Pub did not have a tasting menu, not even a small one, but the prices per plate were extremely reasonable. You could have a nice meal for around $60 plus your drinks, which is normally unheard of, and the potions are healthy. The menu is small, but the classic fare does have its own spin that's tasty. The plating and presentation did not awaken anything in the soul, but it was on point. The execution of the dishes is truly what earns them their 1 Michelin star. I ordered a dry-aged ribeye that was perfectly cooked, topped with Foie and Truffles. It's was superb, so many savory flavors that fill you with opulence. Whatever you order here, it will be done expertly. Recommended, especially for a last minute date night.",
            "Worst part of the experience was that it's not that easy to find off of a map!  Once you've been here it's easy but the first time, you realize you have to turn off of the main road and immediately take a right down the hill and park and then you'll see the entrance off the parking lot, NOT off the main road where the address is. If you see the Chevron gas station, then you want to be turning onto that small road across the street.It's a fancy spot with really good food, amazing service, and an amazing chocolate souffle.  One thing I really liked about them is that they said they don't have a dress code, and they didn't seem to have an issue that I came in once not exactly dressed like I belonged on Sand Hill Road...I think they figure if you are willing to pay their prices then they'll serve you.It's expensive, flat out it is.  But the food is high quality and the service is at that level to match.  The bar looked pretty good but I didn't get anything so can't speak to it, other than it was a nice selection.The soup (vegetable minestrone) was amazing.  Super fresh, light, and the veggies were cooked perfectly.  They even split the portion for us.The schnitzel sounded like a boring dish but our server convinced us and yep it was really yummy.Duck confit has to be my favorite.  So juicy but yet cooked perfectly with a little crisp to it.The steak was kind of ok to me.  Maybe because it didn't seem special.Chocolate souffle.  YES. And it's huge.  You do not need one per person, even if you think you won't share.  Ok, well maybe you do, but we made that mistake and next time we shared it.Overall, nice spot - lots of business looking people, a few families.  Most of the groups look like they intended to dine here.  It's not like you happen upon this spot on a whim.",
            "Traditional white table cloth affair. We went for lunch during the December holiday break. Exceptional service levels and wine list. Arguably one of the best wine lists we have seen in the Bay Area. We ordered the crispy duck confit (with pearled barley and pickled cherries) and the pork schnitzel (with red pears and pork jus). The pork schnitzel was noteworthy-- crispy bread crumb outside and juicy inside; the jus complimented exceptionally well. As a starter, the charcuterie assortment was quality. All in all, great spot for a power lunch or when you fancy something more refined while in the neighborhood.",
            "Please check your bank account a few days after paying. I left the tip in cash and not on my card. However, someone added the waitress an $8 tip without my consent.  I called the store manager and after looking at my receipt he noticed I did not leave the tip card and told me I would get a refund. This is stealing in my opinion. Be careful when using a debit or credit card. Check your statement. By the way service with server was horrible. I am waiting for my refund.",
            "Came here last night for my moms birthday dinner. I will start by saying that the service here was he highlight of my experience. We got here on a bustling Friday night, and got here about 25 mins ahead of our reservation. We had a to wait it out as there was so many people. Once the table was ready we were seated and given a couple different menus. As my family doesn't drink we checked out the dinner and pub menu which had a handful of choices of what we could eat. We ended up ordering the following:* Korean fried chicken- this was spicy crunchy with a twisty tang. Personally I really liked this dish, specially because the sauce * duck- favorite dish I had that night, the duck was absolutely tender and melted in my mouth when I had it. This dish also came with a pea tart where the filling was also duck. Both these preparations were amazing* bavarette steak- this came with 2 duck fat Fries and a salad as well. I thought this steak was a little chewier than my liked but the sauce and butter on top made the food really good. Really enjoyed the fries as well* my parents both ordered the halibut which came with gnocchi and enjoyed their dish as well*for dessert we got the chocolate soufflé which was yummy but a little too rich in chocolate for my liking* for the amouche bouche we were given these cheese puff things in the beginning. Later we were also given orange flavored Madeline cookies and a jelly candyOnce we got the cake we were also given 4 coffee cakes to take home. Overall good experience!",
            "Very expensive but a cult classic so worth trying once. Wouldn't go back for dinner - lunch works out better.Good wine selection and great desserts. Food was meh.",
            "*UPDATE* Took another bff of mine here for dinner and it was amazing! We ordered one round of cocktails, two rounds of bread, and a bottle of wine off their extensive and great list of reds! We had beet salad, lobster bisque, fries for appetizers and then the bone in rib eye, trout, scallops and pasta with freshly shaved black truffle! The highlights were definitely the fries, ribeye and truffle pasta! Service was impeccable! We dressed like crazy rich Asians too. Love the swanky vibe of this joint and glad I returned :-)************************************************Took my bestie here for her birthday brunch. They left her a Card on the table and brought out some complimentary chocolate w a candle for her at the end. (We were too full to order dessert)Drinks were pretty good. Try the autumn fever!For our entrees we got Pub burger (4/5) juicy and good quality beefDuck confit (4.5/5) slightly salty on some bites but great flavor and textures! Lobster quiche (5/5) creamy and deliciousCountry fried steak (1/5) bland, boring compared to the complexity of the other three dishesPortions were goodService was on pointPlenty of parkingAmbiance nice but not pretentious (you can dress in any attire really)Expect to pay a pretty penny for your meal and drinks but definitely worth trying this place out for a special occasion. I would be willing to check out their dinner menu in the future.",
            "I go to The Village Pub for two things, and two things alone:- The Pub Burger (served only during lunch in the dining room, or all day at the bar)- The cocktails (their take on a Greyhound is my favorite)It's a beautiful Michelin starred restaurant, located in the sleepy town of Woodside. This is where the upper crust of the town tend to gather, along with other Peninsula-dwellers. Parking is available in the lot behind the restaurant, and there's dining both inside and outside (although I don't personally see the charm of eating with a view of a parking lot).I would NOT recommend:- the charcuterie (not a lot going on, and some of the meat was dried out in an accidental, not great way)- desserts (a rhubarb tart w/earl grey ice cream was quite disappointing)Keep in mind your meal comes with some gratis desserts, which may include mini canelés, madelines, or pâte de fruit (and sometimes a small cellophane bag of caramel corn or granola!) - a lovely end to your meal.It's not cheap, and I can't say I have interest in trying their other dishes, but this is definitely my favorite high-end burger in the Bay Area.",
            "I really wanted to love this place, but left feeling disappointed. We had a reservation at 8pm and arrived 10 minutes early. They informed us our table wasn't ready and asked us to wait in the bar. Well that wait was over 40 minutes. We didn't not receive service while seated at the bar tables (no one asked if we wanted drinks.) By the time we sat down, we were famished and on a tighter time crunch for relieve the babysitter. It took over 15 minutes to get the menu and what seemed forever to get our wine. They came to pour the glass of wine but the bottle was empty so they needed to get a new one and that took over 5 minutes.Once our food was ordered, it came out quickly as requested. The menu had changed and not updated on their website. I was looking forward to scallops but that had been taken off. The highlight of the meal was the pea soup and soufflé. Both were delicious.Both hubby and I agreed, for the price point there are so many other better options in the area with stellar service. We found the restaurant quite loud. We also didn't not receive any mini desserts which others have discussed.",
            "The food and service are good overall, but some are rather too rich, such as the foie gras and chocolate soufflé, the pork loin dish was recommended by the server but it was not too appetizing. My recommendation is to be very careful with what you order.",
            "The only thing better than the food? The service. Well-deserved Michelin Star. Husbands butternut squash soup was breathtaking as were the duck and chicken. He also loved the chocolate soufflé. But the service was best of all. Friendly, efficient and not intrusive. Loved it",
            "Came here for a small wedding reception in their back banquet/party room.  This is not a \"pub\" in the conventional sense.  It is a very nice restaurant where everyone dresses up.  We had great service and the food was wonderful.  I had the beef filet and it was fantastic.  Very tender and juicy.  The appetizers were great and so was the dessert.  Service was great too.  The entrance to the Village Pub is in the back of the building facing the parking lot behind the Village Pub building.  It's hard to find if you don't know where you're going.  By using their street address, you'll find the building.  Turn down the street next to the building and immediately turn right into their parking lot.  I'd eat here again for sure.",
            "Never been out to Woodside before, but The Village Pub was well worth the trek. It's tucked away in a woodsy area, which matches the restaurant's rustic vibe. - Bread basket: three types of bread, but the rolls are the real winner here. I ate so much bread.. I couldn't resist. If you had to pick just one, get the rolls!! - Burrata: special appetizer of the day, but was extremely disappointing. Did we really just spend $26 on some burrata on top of tomatoes? Not worth- Fries: off the pub menu, really crispy!- Hawaiian kampachi tartare: 4/5 good but nothing I would dream about - Pacific black cod with sake butter: same thoughts as above We went INNNN on the desserts and ordered every single one with the exception of their signature soufflé since our party didn't want to wait..The pineapple and coconut verrine was refreshingly tart, a unique choice with the tapioca pudding and guava sorbet. The apple puff pastry tart with rum ice cream was heavenly, the rum was apparent in this. Chocolate crunch bar was way too rich for me, but a good choice if you're into chocolate. To be honest, for a one Michelin star, The Village Pub did not blow me away. Was expecting a bit more creativity, but what do I know? However, one Michelin star or not, the food's still good, service was superb (water's always filled and bread plate never empty), and the prices won't make your wallet cry (that badly)."

Their calamari is amazing, they serve it with a spicy sauce that gives the dish lots of flavor.Their chicken skewers are also very flavorful and the peanut sauce that it comes with is so good! Their cocktails especially their electric margarita are also very good.",

            "I can stagger home from this place. Well I haven't tried it yet.This place is great though, the clam chowder is wife's favorite as clam chowders go. The crab and shrimp linguine is her go to meal. My favorite? The sourdough bread and butter while I sit outside and look out over the waves. Oh meal? The calamari steak is something I have ordered multiple times. The fish and chips/cole slaw combo is great. Those stand out the most. And the service is really pleasant and friendly also.If you like piano music, they have someone providing music in the evenings. The parking is right next to the place. Just be careful and don't run over any of the tourists taking pictures with their back to the traffic as they stand in the middle of the road taking sunset pics. Sunset heart pic? Lots of them take those. By the way, the patio is dog friendly to man's best friend.A bit on the pricey side though, but then everything on the Coastside is.  So 3.5 stars about right.",
            "No complaints, the food seems better than 10y ago. Steamed mussels and clams combo was hot and the addition of bell peppers gave the sauce an interesting flavor from the normal blandish garlic butter white wine only sauce. The shrimp scallop pasta used the small frozen scallops you get in bulk from the restaurant supply stores. Was edible; not high end seafood. Good enough! Edible, maybe a notch below Fish Market where the food has to be better since they don't have the seaside location to rely on for constant business.",
            "They have complimentary valet parking, but we found some one the street. The views were great but the tables are close together and it was really muggy in there my husband got the steak sandwich which and Cole Slaw. He stated it was really good. I had the Calamari steak with asparagus and basmati rice was good. The rice was pretty bland. It wasn't prepared correctly. Great pianist .  Our server was awesome!",
            "Still a beautiful place to have lunch!  We had their mushroom soup, crab cakes and artichoke - all were so tasty!!  Love this place especially during king tides.",
            "HMB has tons of fabulous dining options but Miramar Beach Restaurant cannot be missed.  The charm, homeyness and warmth is radiant, the food glorious and the service some of the best I've had.  Add a little Terry Disley on the piano and you've got yourself the perfect night out for dinner or drinks. We had Maria as our server and she was so friendly and sweet, my boyfriend and I both kept remarking to each other \"she's sweet\" each time she would come by. I knew everything was going to be great judging by the perfect dirty martini I ordered.  In my experience, that's a sign of a great restaurant.  Next I ordered the French Martini which had vodka, pineapple and Chambord. It was so good I got at least one more after that. :) My boyfriend loved the Jalapeño margaritas. The crab cakes were delicious and perfect, exactly what you'd want in a crab cake with a lemon beur blanc sauce as opposed to a mayo.  Now this is a steakhouse on the water so you can expect great steaks, baked potatoes, grilled fish, etc. but we noticed that the very first item on the menu was Paella. We had just been talking about Paella the nice before so we decided to go for it. It was one of the very best I have ever had. They offered to split it for us which was very nice and at no additional charge. It was chocked full of fresh delicious seafood and the table bread was the perfect sauce sopper.  For dessert we got the dulce de leche cake which was fantastic and went perfectly with our Irish decaf coffees. But the true piece de resistance was that our server, completely as a surprise, coordinated for the piano player to play Happy Birthday on the piano while she sang to my boyfriend and presented him with a complimentary ice cream sundae. He. Started. Crying. It was one of the best nights ever honestly and I owe it to this fantastic restaurant! I love HMB!!",
            "Window seat please . Beautiful day with a beautiful view (sigh)Seafood chowder was amazing Fish and chips was yummy tooService was exceptional",
            "This place has an amazing view, literally breathtaking and unfortunately according our personal experience...this is it.Service/ customer service was lacking since we put the first step in. The hostess at the door barely greeted us, no smile, no eye contact, and after, on the way out, just nothing, not even a \"thank you so much\" or \"have a good evening\". Basically, we were the ones who said \"bye\"  leaving the restaurant, and she barely responded.We didn't feel welcome at all since the beginning.The waiter who served us was still very green, he was not aware of what exact  ingredients were used to prepare that particular dish (having a severe food allergy we needed to know in advance). He took him forever to come to the table and get the order, then he proceed to place our drink order at the bar and spent a considerable amount of time at the bar chatting with the bartender (giving us his back) so when the food runner came out from the kitchen bringing our food out, we couldn't catch his attention to let him know that our food was there, he just needed to bring it to our table! Kind of surreal, right?It was funny in a way, but also a bit annoying!The food itself didn't meet our standards, we are very familiar with the paella, and what we received was a soupy kind of risotto, with super chewy seafood and tons of fat (butter?oil? not a clue, but it was visible on the surface and separated from the rice) it looked like more a fish broth/choppino that a real paella...extremely disappointing.The other dish ordered was the lobster plate,  it's a lobster tail served with one potato and some asparagus. Now, the lobster was absolutely tasteless, the asparagus under cooked and the potato totally raw! No seasoned  at all, just steamed or backed (?) but absolutely plain . Of course, I didn't had a second bite of each, I only had the lobster, period (at that point I was hungry!). When the waiter came back to clean the table, I'm sure he noticed the plate almost intact (except for the lobster, that was gone) he didn't even bother to ask why I didn't eat.So, basically we ended up to pay a lot of money for an amazing view, for sure next time we will enjoy it from the boardwalk :))))))",
            "Over priced but it's the scenery that your paying for  and it's a great view. I ordered the fish and chips for 18 bucks but my friend ordered a shrimp cocktail. It came with those tiny tiny shrimp that can be bought for a dollar. Tartar sauce isn't my favorite and fish is a bit greasy. 2 decent pieces but I won't be back.  Service was fine place is clean.  Jus bit into second piece and it's way over done and dry.  See pic",
            "The views are Beautiful and I will start and end with that. The staff was okay, not extremely friendly in my opinion when we first entered however our server Austin was pleasant. I had a crab melt which was decent and my friend had a seafood pasta with shrimp and crab, no scallops but substituted for extra shrimp. He really enjoyed his meal. We ate outside although quite chilly but the view was beautiful. I couldn't believe like 3 of the heat lamps weren't working. Clearly they didn't all stop working today. I would think for a restaurant that has outside dining and is literally across the street from the beach, ensuring the heat lamps work would be priority but I do understand things happen. Again, staff could be a bit more friendly, beautiful views but would definitely look to try another restaurant when we return.",
            "Location, location, location! On the water eating outside on a beautiful day- yes! Service was prompt. We shared a  bowl of seafood chowder, delicious and flavorful fish and chips, and fish tacos. The Appletini and beer finished off a great lunch date. I saw the calamari and Ceasar salad topped with grilled chicken on someone else's plate. Mental note to self to order this the next time.",
            "We went hear based on Yelp--a gals weekend get-a-way--and it was wonderful! We started out with drinks from the bar: top notch, fair priced, great service. We had calamari as an appetizer and it was good--nothing over the top but the two dipping sauces were good ($15). For dinner we had the Halibut with angel hair instead of rice, seafood (shrimp & crab & mushroom) linguini-white sauce and the scallop & shrimp scampi. Each dish was sooooo good and there was plenty of food! There was bread for the table too and service was super fast. We also started with the spinach salad--great flavor dressing and lots of egg/bacon/onion, and the seafood chowder--this is a must!!!",
            "When a customer tells a restaurant they're coming to celebrate something they should try harder. There's no reason not to have happy customers. Isn't word of mouth the most important aspect of the restaurant business. You can ride on name and reputation for only so long, especially in this area. We we're seated next to the front door. I'd say the whole reason to come to a place like this is hinged on the view. Being stuffed in a corner isn't fun, unless it's the chefs table. It could be better. Just more happy, people come here for a good time, to celebrate and not to just eat good food, what a drag that the foods not very good. The calamari batter had no flavor other than the grease it was fried in. The sauce that acompenied it wasn't bad. It wasn't overly greasy, but you could taste the oil. Fail for the calamari.The Paella was sopping wet or soggy and the Halibut was bone dry and slightly over seasoned.Not at all romantic, there are tv screens with football on over the bar and most of the men can't help but look over to check the score. I would come back here to sit at the bar to watch the game and eat a bowl of chowder. And I would do that with my bro friend this is not a super romantic place. For appetizers and drinks cuz it's right next to the beach, might be kind of a stretch though.What we have here is a well-known restaurant that seems to have taken a downward turn.",
            "Awesome location off Hwy 1, down a small street right on the bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in all her glory! We came here on a Sunday and had brunch. We were really surprised by the food. Most restaurants with views are just that, all view and marginal food. We ate the crab cake Benedict's with a cup of chowder on the side. It's was great! New England clam chowder is good stuff with clams not loaded down with potatoes. The Benedict was perfect! All fresh, hot and tasty! The menu is pretty extensive, everyone can find something on this menu. Restaurant is nice inside with central bar area. There's outside seating and plenty of it. We sat inside because there were not shady areas on the patio-seating looked great we just didn't want to be in the sun long. Service was friendly and good on time.The nice perk is free valet in their little lot, just tip the valet. He was really friendly and was organizing cars like a pro!Give it a try and enjoy the view! If you're feeling like a walk after your meal, out the doors to your left is some local art, cute coffee house and some interesting housing towards the end of the bluff street, small spiritual center. Nice photo opportunities, too!",
            "So finding this restaurant was an absolute fluke. My friend was in town from New York and showing bringing her to half moon bay was a must. As we were approaching the area, we thought why not have dinner with a view. I instantly got on to yelp and began reading reviews, and it seemed like a good choice so we decided to give it a try.My friend is not a huge seafood eater, so I was slightly worried what she would eat and if theyd have good non seafood options for her. Once we got there we had asked the hostess if it were possible to get a table by window so we can enjoy the sunset view. She said, it would be a 20-25 minute wait, so we ended up waiting and it was worth the wait!! we got seated by the window and it was stunning view of the water and the sun setting. The inside of the restaurant is had an old wooden interior, but well kept.okay, so the food, they had a variety to choose from even for my friend who does not enjoy seafood as much even had a lot to pick from, however she decided to give a seafood entree a try. We began with their cheesy garlic bread, which was delicious! I ordered the parmesan encrusted petrale sole and my friend got, baked halibut filet with garlic and herb. Our dishes were served with a choice of basmati rice or garlic mash. The fish was so FRESH with a lot of great flavors I was delighted and enjoy each bite of our food. I can't wait to be back in the area to go again and try something new!",
            "My boyfriend and I frequent the same restaurant when we go to Half Moon Bay, but I wanted to switch it up and try someplace new. I found Miramar Beach on Open Table, and what got me was its location by the water. Parking is limited, but the restaurant offers complimentary vallet. We came on a partly cloudy and windy day, so we opted to sit inside. We lucked out and were seated at a table right by the window facing the bay. I found that no matter where you sat in the restaurant, you pretty much had a decent view. The outdoor patio, however, was lovely! There were fire pits going, so I'm sure that the customers braving the cold were comfortable enough. I will be looking forward to lounging out there during the summer. Customer service was great overall. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. He went above and beyond to ensure that we were taken cared of. We received our appetizer fairly quickly, but it took a while for our main courses to come out. I wasn't perturbed about it though. This is not the type of restaurant you would want to come to eat fast or dine in a rush. I loved being present and enjoying the sights and sounds. The resident pianist was amazing. His name is Terry Disley, and he was SLAYING it live on the piano. He played his own arrangements of a variety of contemporary (like Despacito) and old songs (Carpenters - Close to You comes to mind). The customers, including we, were so into his song list! He performs 3-4 times a week at Miramar Beach Restaurant, and I would highly recommend just coming by for drinks and singing along with him while he performs lol. My boyfriend and I ordered the calamari appetizer to share. The calamari were lightly battered, which I prefer. The calamari were chewy and lacked a bit of flavor and saltiness, but the dipping sauces made up for it. There were a lemony tartar sauce and spicy, cheesy marinara sauce.I had the Dungeness crab sandwich for my main course, and my boyfriend had the shrimp scampi platter. The sandwich comes out open faced. One side is the crab salad and cheese melted on a slice of sourdough. The other slice of sourdough is topped with avocado, red onions, lettuce, and tomatoes. The sandwich is light and tastes very fresh. My boyfriend's shrimp scampi was delicious. The shrimp was cooked well, and I liked the wine sauce.",
            "I had a worst experience dining today for brunch! The host (older lady in black)We were offered sit at at fire pit, I understand it's a share table. as a courtesy of a  host from an nice restaurant, I'd think she would ask if it's ok for other customer to join. Instead she start moving my stuff n purse without my permission. She even more concern about what others customer ( the white couple) wants then mine. I felt like I'm not a paying customer at all, or she is being racist to me n my friend!!! Moreover, I complaint to the manager n they didn't do nothing about it !! Disappointed ....",
            "First time here and probably the last time. I ordered the burger with bacon and Swiss. First off the burger came with bacon, and when I let the waitress know, she brought a plate over over cooked brittle dry bacon that was barely room temp. I sent the whole thing back. Attempt number two came back far too quick, and was obviously the same burger and the same bacon. Sent back again, this time the bacon was halfway decent, but it's obvious their burger patties aren't made in house, but resemble Costco patties in shape, taste, and texture. Also the third time, no onions and not tomatoes. Had to flag down the manager to get these items. Now, he is a whole other story. He was a smug uncaring, with no compassion of even the slightest air of caring. He brought back a plate of vegetable, and handed it to me in the most condescending of ways. Learned later he is the son of the owner, and it shows in his entitled smug demeanor, wonder if his parents have any idea of horrible he treats his customers, it's obvious he doesn't understand the restaurant business and what it means to be an owner. I will say the patio is lovely, as is the view. If only recommend this place if you want a good view to sit and have a few drinks, but the service and the food is sorely lacking.",
            "Menu: pretty limitedLocation: a great spot on the waterfrontAtmosphere: up-casual indoors, casual outdoorsCleanliness: excellentStaff: very friendlyService time: very fastValue: poorWhy only 2 stars?The absence of decent  flavors. If Yelp bills a spot as a \"seafood\" restaurant, then I expect to see some exciting seafood dishes on the menu, not a ho-hum selection of also-rans. The chowder was the same as they carry at Costco, but wasn't bad. The halibut was a dry and mostly flavorless. The paella was a major fail. Soupy paellas are often tough to deliver, and this one proves why. It was loaded with bell peppers, which completely dominated the taste, the saffron second. If the bell pepper is your thing, you'll likely enjoy this dish, but when it's not even mentioned on the item's description in the menu, it's not a pleasant surprise to receive a bowlful of them. I suppose I should blame myself for expecting a \"seafood\" dish to taste like seafood.The prices were high, but in line with what you'd expect to pay at that location. The flavors, however, did not match the prices at all. No matter where you are, if an entrée is $30, it's fair to expect it to be well above diner quality, not below.The front and table staff were wonderful, but I would encourage some upgrades in the kitchen."

            "So I'm pretty late on this place, but better late than never right? Anyways, I ordered the the 2 Meat Combo and the Sandwich Combo and they satisfied my craving for bbq! I definitely preferred the 2 Meat Combo; it was cooked just right and I appreciated having the bbq sauce on the side so that it wouldn't be a soggy mess and so that I'd have the option of having it with or without sauce (rather than having it drowned in sauce with every bite).To get more into specifics, the ribs were fall off the bone delicious and the brisket was definitely something else (in a good way of course)! This place is a must try for bbq!",
            "Got here 2 hours after opening and they were out of brisket, chicken, and pulled pork. Ended up getting the ribs and hot links, both of which were pretty average. Huge portions though! Overall wasn't impressed with the food, but it wasn't bad either. Will probably come here again to try their brisket before casting another irrelevant yelp review.Service was awesome though. The staff is very friendly and welcoming!",
            "The kids and I worked up an appetite exploring Mori Point for a few hours before we stopped by Gorilla Barbeque.  The portions here are HUGE!  The 3-meat combo literally was a half pound per meat option, the pork ribs were the size of beef ribs, and the half chicken was pretty big too.  We were hungry, but probably wouldn't even finish all the food if another family was with us.I really enjoyed the BBQ sauce here.  It's not overly sweet like traditional bbq sauce.  It had the perfect tangy and sweet balanced taste and went well with all the meat cuts.I didn't care for the side as much, but the flavorful meat and delicious bbq sauce were definitely the stars.The line seemed long, but it moved very quickly and efficiently.  The staff was incredibly welcoming and friendly.  There wasn't much seating, so we just sat in the back of the Rav 4 and dug in.",
            "Who knew that looking for a wedding venue could stir such an appetite? From Half Moon Bay we remembered that we would cross paths with Gorilla Barbeque. Well why not, it was on the way back home!As one drives you can't miss the lone orange train with the sign tempting you to turn into their lot. I mean who does not like bbq? The huge parking lot also serves as \"seats\" for those who do dine in their car. There are a few table to the side as well, but in the past I found it too windy. The prices here are a great deal for the amount of food. We have ordered the 2 meat combo in the past and is more than enough to hold you down until dinner.  For meats our favorite is the ribs and the chicken. They are both juicy and full of flavor! When it comes to sides we do like to accompany our meats with the cole slaw and mac 'n' cheese. The food here is just simple comfort and at the right price.If you are driving and see Gorilla Barbeque take a rest break to fuel up!",
            "Stopped by hear on a whim while staying at a nearby hotel for work and although the place is just a pop in old train cargo box, it's worth it! I got a side of ribs (4) and bbq zucchini. The meat just fell off the bone ....delicious! It filled me up!!! I was a bit bummed I didn't have an appetite for more! Highly recommend this place to stop while driving through, vacationing, or as a local.",
            "Went to Mori Point last weekend for some gorgeous views and finished it with a giant BBQ meal that I couldn't finish at Gorilla Barbeque. It's all takeout so my friend and I had to find random outdoor place to eat in the lot nearby, but portions for ribs were huge and I definitely recommend the mac & cheese side. Not sure if I was just super hungry, but it was exactly what I needed after a little hike.",
            "It was excellent and just way I like it big portions and the price was reasonable. I had the ribs and brisket those were some of the biggest ribs I've seen and they were tender. The brisket was juicy and it was also a big portion. It comes with rice and beans but I was already full I'll be back",
            "Came for weekday lunch. Glad to see they don't have the crazy long lines as they did in the past. Delicious bbq and sides. Prices are ok, but a little high for take out only. I had the brisket sandwich today which was tender, had lots of juicy meat, and had lots of flavor. Service was friendly. They would benefit from a bench or 2, or a few tables to sit for lunch.",
            "Holy moly the portion they gave you is generous! We got a two meat combo with brisket and pulledPork and it was delicious! Good seasoning, came with corn bread, beans and rice, and two sides of or choice. We got the Mac and cheese which was flavorful and the potato salad. Even between a friend and I, we couldn't finish the whole meal and had some meat leftovers for dinner.Parking is easy, they have a parking lot. There are some other small businesses adjacent like a coffee shop with some ample parking. We came on a Saturday around 12:45 pm and there was a modest line out the door.",
            "Although it seems like an unassuming spot, it is a well-known gem in the Bay Area.Gorilla BBQ has one of the best BBQ in the area, and this is even attested for by my Texan buddy who would complain about the lack of good BBQ in the area.If you plan on coming, I would recommend coming around 11:30-11:45 to get in line. There will be a fairly sizeable line upon opening, especially if you are coming here on the weekend.As for the food, you get really large portions for what you pay for. Around 25 bucks, you will get an entire plate with three types of meat and some sides, which is enough to feed 2-3 people. Parking is behind the gas station or in the same parking lot. 5 stars for a wonderful establishment!",
            "Finally made it here after missing it so many times due to it being closed for one reason or another or them running out of food. Definitely the go to bbq spot in the bay! Brisket was very tender and tasted great, a little too much fat for my taste and I really like fatty brisket. These cows must be fed and treated well to get so much marbling on them! Asked for a side of mushrooms as well and they were great! Very meaty and season very well!",
            "I have had the food here a few times with the latest being take out that a friend brought over. This place makes some legit BBQ! Very yummy. The portions are big with very reasonable prices. Highlights are the ribs and brisket which pairs well with the corn bread. Just make sure to not go too late as they sometimes run out of the more popular items. Can't wait to go back!",
            "Right off the coast, this gem lives up to its hype. I ordered a chicken sandwich and the portions were generous. Not to mention how good the bbq sauce is, and how nice the staff were! Next time I think I'll be having the 2 piece combo but for now this will do. I'll be back for sure in the near future. Thank you Gorilla Barbeque!",
            "I was drawn in by the description of the Mac and cheese topped with chip crumbs, but after eating it, it wasn't the same. I have eaten here on a number of different occasions. At the time of my last visit, it was on a weekday before 5pm, the restaurant had already sold out of the ribs, pulled pork and brisket - they are the popular items, and worth it. I was craving ribs, and was so sad that I missed the party for ribs that night. There is plenty of free ample parking which is great because you may need to eat in your car since the restaurant is only a take-out place. I ordered the grilled eggplant but wasn't too much of a fan. The corn on the cob is good, even though I don't usually eat corn. If you are in the area, and like BBQ, then this is the place to go.",
            "Very good food. I always get the 1 meat combo. The ribs are delish and so is the brisket.",
            "Probably the best bbq joint i tried yet so far! I came here thinking the portions was going to be fair size or just small in general like other bbq joints. But boy oh boy i was sooo wrong! I got the two item meal with brisket and ribs, for the sides i got mac n cheese with coleslaw. Each plate i believe comes with beans and rice, with corn bread. And here i thought i was going to get the 3 item hahaha i would've never finish it if that the case! Let me start off by saying the brisket is sooooo juicy and tender, it has such an even ratio between lean and fat. The ribs were sooo huge, not really fall off the bone type of ribs, but still very good! The coleslaw and mac n cheese was very good as well! Mac n cheese uses gold fish flakes on top, only thing i thought could work a little better is the beans and rice. Cornbread to end it all was very flavorful, very sweet with actual corn inside, a little fluffy as well. To end it here, i thought this place is well worth the drive. I live in the east bay area, and it took about 40-an hr drive to this place. And i don't think the drive was regrettable at all, everything was soo worth the drive and nothing was bad. The food came out extremely quick! So thats a big plus. Only thing i would like to see from them to change is to put benches and tables so we can dine in or outside. My friends and i just ate in the car, which we did not mind at all, we were all just very quick to start grubbing! Sooooo.... i definitely recommend anybody in the bay or anybody around the world to try this place! I heard guy fieri came here for his tv show dine in at diners or whatever! So yuppp definitely a must try for bbq lovers!",
            "Haha I found this place on Yelp, and the reviews did not lead me astray. I love the barbecue rub they use. The flavors just hit all the right spots with me. I ordered the two meats combo, brisket and ribs. You get three huge pork ribs and three long slices of briskets. The ribs were to die for, so soft and fleshy all the right parts. None of them are hard or tough at all. The sauce is another incredible point to note. My bf doesn't like barbecue sauce in general because of the weird tangy taste and aftertaste, but he said this one was different. It doesn't have that weird tanginess. I'm sure that they made theirs in house. Truly special. The brisket was less mind blowing than the ribs, but by no means average. The flavors permeated into the meat and it was tender. But it wasn't super fall of the fork per se. I still had to do some sawing with my knife. It resisted a bit, but not too much. It was a lot of brisket though.. Yum. Their mac n cheese is also super great. Gosh it's actually one of the best I've had in a while. The two things that were ordinary were the potato salad side and cornbread. It's not bad by any measure, it's just the most ordinary out of everything I ordered.Lots of parking, take out only, they take card.",
            "Pretty good bbq.  The place is set up for takeout, so be prepared for this.  They run out of a lot of items fast and it's a small operation.  Decent place for a casual meal if you're in the area.",
            "Yum! The BBQ here is absolutely delicious. It is no Texas BBQ, but pretty damn decent for CA BBQ. The food truck is located unsuspectingly by the road, but there was a long line on a Sunday afternoon since they are apparently pretty famous. Prices are on the high side, but portions are super generous. My friend and I shared a 3 meat combo and we had enough leftovers for dinner. Grab the food to go and eat/ hang out at the beach on a good day. It's worth it!",
            "Good food! Full of flavor!! The sauce is magical!! You definitely get a full plate and your money's worth. If you're ever in SF check them out."

            "Great breakfast place if you are a Pilot. I am ordering Crab Omelette today. Nice weather today; we are sitting outside. Service is great and food is perfect.",
            "Not to shabby, go stop for breakfast on a semi sunny day. The view is of an airfield outside, if you don't mind the cold you can eat outside with the elements attacking you (slight wind chill during winter time). The bonus is if any of these small biplanes land you can see it first hand outside. From the inside you can see the planes once they land but not as much as if you were outsideThe food was good, with a toddler and 8yr old they were very pleased with their food.Here is what we sampled and how it all fairedThe chicken fried steak, size wise was decent, no it did not taste like freshly battered steak but it did have its perks, the meat was semi hard, still enough to cut it apart without a knife but an edge of a spoon, the hash browns and the over easy eggs were made just right. The meat again was not rubbery it was more of slightly tender thin sliced meat that was super deep fried, with that white gravy all over the top. I would come back and order this again. The wife ordered an omelette with black beans, pico de gallo, latin rice on the side, I want to say the omelette had sliced onions, bell peppers and chorizo, again the meat I did not recall but the whole dish of what I sampled was delicious, see pictures below hahaThe kids they ordered the pancakes, my son the 2 stack pancakes, my daughter the child mickey mouse pancakes, all made with buttermilk, fluffy, dense, and delicious my 3yr old kept sayingThe interior was a little odd, as if it was something else before, definitely not a restaurant. the whole interior on the walls were filled with pictures of the past, the ceilings had several model planes hanging, take your idevices away from the kids and have them look around explore the walls and the model planes hangingDefinitely a place I would visit againfood **** better then decent servings hereprice $$service ***** daughter spilled milk all over the floor, quickly cleaned up, no one batted an eye, I guess it happens here sometimes hahaambiance **** the pictures, model planes, pretty much everything about this place is a gem. try to get a seat by the airfield.",
            "Reportedly Closed.Loved this place R.I.P 3-zero.The county seems to have closed it this past weekend. Call the airport authority of San Mateo County to fix this.",
            "Permanently closed! Lost it's lease from the county! This is a terrible loss to the area, 3-Zero was a classic place that will be greatly missed.March 30, 2019 was the last day of business.",
            "This is a cool place with fun things to look at and I like their pancakes (blueberry), but I ordered an eggs Benedict and one of the eggs was hard-boiled so not great. Also the server (I think he may be the owner) can be abrasive towards customers.",
            "3-Zero Cafe \"serves\" a decent breakfast. Some smallish orange juice. But it's FRESH OJ so that makes up for the $4 cost somewhat.  The rest is a solid breakfast place. Order came back accurately cooked and served.  However, avoid the chicken-fried steak as it's frozen, not fresh.   If you sit outside then be prepared for poor service. I would categorize the service as \"get off yer own butt and get it yourself\" service. Don't expect to be checked on have water refilled, or even have the check brought out to you without getting up to ask for what you need.Internet here is free.  But amoung the slowest I have encountered in a long time. If you need Internet for remote work then tether to your mobile data service. On the other hand AT&T or Verizon service is the fastest I have seend. When tethering or using your phone with mobile data expect 136 MB down and 40 MB up.The scenery is really why you would stop here. On a sunny day the view of aircraft coming and going is simply wonderful.  Pilots who fly in for breakfast park their aircraft just 50 feet from the outside. Great for a lazy breakfast or lunch.Overall the value for a 3-Zero Cafe experience still up above average even with the poor service.  I recommend you give 3-Zero Cafe a try on a sunny day.",
            "This place is great but it also has some quarks The guy who runs the show has more respect for the local folks he recognizes. There is no flexibility with ordering (could I get that a certain way??) and there is a lack of appreciation for the clientele. Speaking of the clientele, it's mostly older white people. The rigidity and inflexibility makes for a difficult visit sometimes. There is no comfort for the lactose intolerant, no almond or soy milk.The guy I mentioned who would favor the locals, he has a bit of an attitude. Most places would end up being out of business if they treated all the customers with such an attitude. Somehow in this area it's not a big deal. There is a good side to all of this. The Classic Cafe with a Twist towards the International fair. Standard dishes that go a little further and have a ton of flavor.",
            "We came here for eggs benedict! Not burgers, not fries but eggs benedict as we were told from our friends. They were delicious! I had the veggie benedict, boyfriend had bacon benedict in which he switched out the Canadian bacon for regular and his father had the crab cake benedict. We were starving and the food filled us up! The service was great and we will be back! Thank you 3 Zero Cafe for hospitality!",
            "After visiting the restaurant on so many occasions I have to say that my latest visit was very disappointing. The server was extremely short with us and seemed to be rushed whenever he came to our table. It just seemed like he was trying to get us in and out as fast as possible. The food was also lacking on this occasion. I ordered steak and eggs and my steak was over cooked and didn't taste like a freshly seasoned piece of meat. I really liked this place before this visit and had visited on several occasions. I'm not sure if it was just a bad day for them but I hope that they can improve. Given this last experience, it will be hard to justify driving all the way back out here to eat.",
            "Holy moly. What a nightmare. Upon walking in, no one greets you. There is a sign. \"If it appears we are busy, put your name on the list. If not, seat yourself.\" Ummm ok... we tell them we would like a table and the man was so inconvenience he might as well rolled his eyes. We sat outside and it was beautiful with the planes and the great weather. He comes over and says, \"the wait for food for 45 minutes if you want to order... there are lots of people ahead of you.\" ...... ok got it. We will order. Him: what do you want? Me: brioche French toastHim: next. Guest: fish tacos Him: next Guest: fish and chips Him: next His \"I don't give a F\" attitude was really bad. I wanted to tell him to cheer up. It's a new year. Food took 45 minutes. Nothing good. Very sub par. The service really left a bad taste in my mouth prior to even tasting the food.",
            "Not bad not great. Maybe it's what I got which was the chicken fried steak and eggs. Eggs were good, steak was missing something, potatoes were good but a little under cooked and not very hot. I got English muffin but my husband never got his for the same plate ordered which was ok because I didn't want mine. Coffee was good and service was good. Next time I'll go back to The Press, but hey you gotta try new stuff. I'd really like to give this cute little place 3.5 Stars but settled for 3. I thought k the better price point for this meal would be $11.95 vs. $13.95. Again I want to stress that nothing was really wrong with this place, just a little underwhelmed overall.",
            "What a hidden gem. Great breakfast spot, full plate servings. Great vibe, with outdoor and indoor seating.",
            "Went on a weekday to try this place out and avoid the wait, so there weren't a lot of customers inside. It was seat yourself, otherwise there's a waiting list that you put yourself on when it is crowded. They have an extensive menu for brunch. Have to take one star off for cleanliness. There were ants on the wall trim right next to the tables. The floors are super dirty because when I went to pick something up my fingers were all black.Another star off for service. Our waiter was fine and even suggested Mickey Mouse pancakes which my daughter loved. The busgirl and kitchen staff not so much. We never got our waters refilled. Our waiter was gone and we just wanted a to go box, so my husband waited in front of the open kitchen. The woman saw him waiting and just ignored him, so did the kitchen workers. They just continued to talk to each other while the woman pretended to keep busy. Now I see what another reviewer meant by the workers avoiding eye contact, so they don't have to deal with you. Ended up waiting for our waiter to come back.Food: typical diner food. The best part was the pancakes. I ordered the fajita lunch and wish I just ordered the pancakes. The texture of the \"steak\" they use was weird like ground meat and not a lot of flavor to anything. The husband had an omelette, but he said it was nothing special. So if you really want to try this place come on a weekday and order the pancakes. I would definitely not wait for a long time on a weekend.",
            "I have to say, I'm a little disappointed with our last visit. We've been to this place many times, in fact, we drive over an hour to come here. But the service as well as the food wasn't great today and has almost made me not want to come back. When walking in, the man who was seating tables would speak across the restaurant saying the parties name then point to a table and said \"sit there\". I was taken back by him rushing around. Especially when I was mid order and he just replied to me \"take your time\" and then proceeded to walk away. We also had three different people come to our table to take our order.My food, which was an omelette, was good. It had lots of cheese, which I appreciate! But my potatoes were borderline raw. My husband ordered a medium rare steak with sunny side up eggs but the steak came back well done and the eggs were really undercooked. I'm hoping it was just an off day for them because we usually love this place!",
            "It's funny that as many times as I have flown in to KHAF, it never really occurred to me to eat here, since there is so much good stuff literally a short walk away. \"The best breakfast in town.\" Well, you can make that claim undisputed when you're the only breakfast in town (and this is where the whole town shows up to have breakfast). And the food is good - as qualified below.I ding them a star for a couple reasons. First of all, the place is \"A-okay\" and the food is good. But it's not a very accommodating place to eat if you're on a special needs diet. If you're a low carb person go someplace else. I wasn't hungry so I ordered the \"eggs just right\" breakfast and figured there would be two eggs and just a piece of toast and a bit of hash browns I could discard. I felt bad. There were two little eggs sunny side up and a massive pile of potato, and biscuit. It all smelled good, but I couldn't eat it. I guess I should have just asked them for two eggs on the side or something. Oh yeah, the second. They had crab omelet. Yay. Except, the crab was cold, as if it was frozen and thawed for the omelet. It was reported to be \"good\" but, well, details, details.Now I did see a bunch of platters of stuff that looked very appetizing, including some of the poached egg creations. Again, nothing I could touch, but, for those so inclined, you can't go too wrong here. The staff is very friendly. Service is a tad slow but the place was packed when we all went there, to be fair.I think I wouldn't mind trying them again for lunch and maybe a salad but damn, there are some seriously good restaurants just outside the door of the south ramp area.",
            "Were some complaints about the food a couple of months ago.  Turns out, he had to hire and train replacement cooks.  I ran into the sister waitresses at Safeway and asked how things were going, and they said the food was back up to par now [and so were their tips], and that they'd bet their tips on it.  Went today with a friend, and if anything it's slightly better than ever.  The home fries now come with sauteed vegetables mixed in with the potatoes, and the omelette had a buttery smooth texture.  Back in the saddle again!",
            "Fun little restaurant with nice variety and good breakfasts. Would love to see them offer gluten free toast and turkey bacon!!Looking forward to visiting again.",
            "The decor of the cafe is cute, with an airplane theme, and is actually attached to the Half Moon Bay Airport office. It's a quaint, typical cafe. Large food selection. We ordered the brioche French toast and the pilot's plate. The pilots plate was a scrambled egg and vegetable platter (zucchini, artichokes, mushrooms), scalloped potatoes, and an English muffin. The vegetables were a nice combination and unusual find. I ordered a side order of bacon with that, extra crispy, but when it arrived, it was cooked like typical bacon. The brioche French Toast was topped with fresh blueberries, strawberries, and a berry compote. The fruits were sour/tart, despite it being berry season (summer). The French Toast was buttery and slightly sweet. The presentation was pretty, and compensated for the disappointing taste. The male server was funny and friendly, and obviously worked hard. He also served as our cashier when the meal was over. We had water and coffee, and once our food came, we were never visited by our server again - likely because he was too busy servicing other tables. The female server was quite the opposite. Although she wasn't our server, I observed her work ethic and customer service - stoic, unfriendly, and slow moving.",
            "The worst service I ever experienced.It's been an hour since we entered the door and 45 minutes since we have ordered our breakfast. Still sitting and waiting. A waiter explained it saying: You see, we have another guests, that's why so long. Update: breakfast was ok."

            "Still soft opening so not many people, need no wait for Sunday dinner. AYCE has reasonable price and non-discounted service. Ingredients were fresh. Soups were incredible flavorful. Honestly I didn't expect that great soup base because I heard of this store as 'sister store of tasty pot' and tasty pot was famous for extremely bland soup bases. I also like their sauce bar. The only con may be limited selection of dishes which might be because it was just soft opening. This mall has a slightly deserted feeling to me. If appropriate, FENG SHUI could be improved in the interior for better vibes.Will come back.",
            "3.5 stars. Called at 7:18pm today to add my name to the wait list. Was told that there were three parties ahead of us with an approximate wait time of 20 minutes. We arrived 30 minutes later and the wait list had not moved at all. We ended up waiting another 30 minutes before we were seated.Service was pretty slow at the beginning and food was coming out at a snail's pace. We ended up getting some meats before our soup came out. They were also out of quite a few items. I get that it is their soft opening weekend so I am cutting them some slack. The manager did come by a couple times to apologize for the long wait and them running out of certain items which I appreciate. Overall, I thought that the soup bases were tasty (we tried the house special spicy and the seafood broth) and the meats were really fresh but I would like to see a bigger selection of items. I also wish their skewers were part of the AYCE price (they currently charge $0.50 per skewer). I would come back again but only if there was no wait.",
            "Nice new addition to the Daly City hot pot scene. It's the sister restaurant to Tasty Pot, but in my opinion, the more refined one. Supreme Pot has a tablet ordering menu that allows you to make you're own hot pot soup selection. You're allowed two styles per hot pot, which is a pretty cool feature.There are about six hot pot soup broths, but warning to vegetarians, only two are water based so ask before order. The options for soup toppings were plentiful with a wide array of vegetables, seafood, and meat. During this experience we ordered tofu, taro, achoy, bokchoy, potatoe, daiko, broccoli, and a few more yummy seafood options which my husband enjoyed. In addition to the wide array of options we were ordered, we were given a seafood platter with crab legs, shrimp, mussel, fish, and squid.  This was an opening day special which made my husband's eyes light up as he's a huge seafood fan. While we waited for the soup and toppings, we headed over the sauce bar and the sides bar. The sauce bar had a ton of mix ins as well as garlic, ginger, etc. The sides bar had fresh fruit, sesame balls, edamame, etc. Overall it was a great experience. The servers were friendly, the spicy broth was true to its name (definitely had a kick to it), and the mix-ins/toppings were super fresh. Definitely a great start for this new Daly City locale.",
            "I went here for lunch on the second day of there soft opening. I believe they don't have all you can eat on the weekdays lunch  but they do have it at night time. I ordered there lunch special which was 13.99 which is not including the 10 percent off they are giving with the soft opening.  Pretty good deal. For the lunch special you get to choose two broths I chose Chinese herbal and sukiyaki. Then you choose choice of protein I believe they have beef, pork, chicken and lamb. I chose the beef. Lastly the last thing you choose is the carb option which is rice, instant noodles, vermicelli noodles and udon. The broth was very flavorful. I like the fact that the Chinese herbal broth was really herbal. The sukiyaki taste like real Japanese sukiyaki broth also. The lunch special comes with a bowl of fish balls, mushrooms, lettuce, enoki mushrooms, imitation crab, and other stuff. The beef was pretty good too. They have a sauce bar with a lot of different kinds of dipping sauces but they didn't have ponzu sauce. My friend tried the house special spicy broth which the waiter said was from Chengdu China very spicy. Make sure you can handle spicy if you order that. The service was pretty good and they were nice. I would definitely come again."
