            "You usually don't give this high of a rating to tourist traps which is what I intially thought through bad experiences in hyped up places in super touristy spots. As a Bay Area local, this my friends is not one of those places! Service was great, (props to our server Justin!)  On a super busy Sunday Dinner Rush, our service was prompt, helpful, Justin tended to our needs quickly and even put on our seafood bibs! Finally, we were there for a bday and Justin kindly hooked us up with a dessert! The food: food quality usually lacks in these types of restaurants but not here! Seafood and meat entrees were great! We had the Seafood tower which is on the pricier sad but everything on it was super fresh and incredible and best for all seafood lovers. Though surprisingly the STAR of the show is the Mussel Fries! Whatever the sauce comes with these is an incredible mix of flavors. I've had many Mussels dishes, this seriously tops them all. All of our entrees (two pasta dishes, a seafood mixed grill, and a flat iron steak) were all great as well. All was finished except that my seafood grill had Sole on it which is bland for me but not their fault. Everything else on my plate was delicious.Whether you're a local or a visitor, put this spot on your list! Beat the crowd and go on a weekday or make rezzies.",
            "Ordered: half dozen oysters, crab cake and cioppino.Oysters were so fresh and sweet. I'm usually used to the happy hour blue pt oysters but these were smaller but sweeter.Crab cakes were great as well.First time trying cioppino. I really enjoyed it. We got it lazy style and crab meat was already picked out for us.Service was great. Atmosphere would be great for date night. We were sat by a window and overlooking the boats and water.",
            "It was a good dining experience we had the following:Chowder with Crab - Some of the best chowder I've had the crab was a delicious addition. Crab Ceviche - Very fresh and tasty! Whole Steamed Crab - Freshness was excellent but was a bit bland.  Mixed Grill - Seasoned well very good."

            "Booking reservations for this place was incredibly easy. It's not too overly crowded. I booked the night before and got a reservation for 12 during their busy brunch hours. First off, I just want to say how much I appreciate the effort and love that went into this place. Everything from the hardwood flooring to the decor to the food, was just phenomenal. Such a gorgeous brunch place with ample amount of outdoor seating. It has a more rustic vibe but with a lot of natural lighting. So great for a sunny day!My boyfriend and I got the loco moco, the French toast, and the fried chicken eggs benedict. My favorite one was the loco moco. The beef patty was extremely well seasoned and they paired with kimchi to give it a nice kick along with the gravy! It was my favorite thing there and I highly suggest you to try it. Service was also great! Everyone was super friendly and accommodating. I love places like these and we need more of it in San Francisco. The aesthetic of this restaurant was perfection.",
            "Fusion food is always a great choice for brunch! I've always heard about Surisan but had never gone because it's in such a busy location with terrible parking, but my friend was having her birthday brunch here so it was a good excuse to try it out.The service was really good, considering we had a huge group of around 18 people. They were very diligent on getting our orders and making sure our drinks were always filled up.I got a vanilla latte, the Dolsot with bulgogi, + shared the Millionaire's Bacon flight with friends. The dolsot came in a super hot sizzling cast iron pan, with rice, veggies and delicious umami bulgogi! The gochujang sauce on the side was super spicy and well balanced as well. It was such a huge meal, I had lots of leftovers for dinner the same night. :) The bacon flight was also amazing! Tender, juicy, thick cut bacon in 4 different flavors. I wouldn't say the flavors varied all that much, it was honestly hard to notice, so maybe just order a side of the Millionaires bacon rather than the flight because its cheaper. Most of my friends got cocktails and bottomless mimosas, which were always being refilled diligently by the wait staff.I definitely want to come back sometime to try their other brunch menu items + their dinner menu. Very trendy & delicious, however pretty pricey. This ended up being around a $45 meal, but fairly worth it because of the company I had with me. :)",
            "The worst restaurant ever in the U.S. Very Dishonest businessl practice. They absolutely had no care about their customers. The waitress didn't honor our reservation, she refused to seat us even we arrived 5, 6 mins earlier than our reservation time. We had made a reservation on OpenTable for March 5th, 2019, 2:30pm, Tuesday. I even called the restaurant to ask the waitress where can we park and told her that we have a reservation with OpenTable and are on our way driving to the restaurant now when we were driving heading to the restaurant from the Outer Sunset to fisherman's Wharf. When we arrived we told the waitress we had a reservation with Opentable for 2:30pm, and the waitress told us that they are closed, their last seating is at 2:15pm. But we told her that your last seating on Opentsble is at 2:45pm that we saw and we showed her the phone to let her see that. It was 2:25pm at that time, it is only 10 mins passed their (inaccurate) last seating time. We told her there's no way that you don't honor our reservation since we had made a reservation on Opentable for 2:30pm and the time we arrived were at 2:25pm. The reservation was confirmed on the app and by email. We even told the waitress that we will eat faster and finish before 3pm. At that time, there were still 3 tables eating at the restaurant. But she still refuse to let us do dine-in and force us to get take out instead. The waitress is absolutely the coldest waitress we have seen and experienced since living in the U.S. for so long. Does the 10 mins passed their (inaccurate) last seating time really make a big impact/ difference on them?? We also asked to speck to the manager, but the waitress didn't let us to talk to the manager about this either.We were forced to get take out instead. We were so....so..angry and confused at that time but still ordered two meals for take out. And later when we returned home, I received a email from OpenTable said that we didn't show up for our reservation...., which means what, they marked us as No Show to avoid paying their $2.00 reservation fee. But we already spent $57 ordered for take out for one Crab Benedit and one Loco Moco. And we showed up to the restaurant 5 or 6 mins earlier than our reservation time and got being turn away. Very dishonest business practice, not sure is the waitress who worked there's intention to mark us as No Show or other staffs, but this is absolutely unacceptable and unforgivable. We were absolutely angry at that point even until weeks later when writing this review we still cannot cool off our anger. The food we got were bland and nothing special at all. The food portion were very small given the price they charged. The crab benedit tasted bad, the crab texture was very dry, cheap quality of crab meat that they used, the crab portion were very little, it costed $24.00 before tax for this fish. The Loco Moco were bland and nothing impressive at all. The place is absolutely over-rated and is a tourist trap. Expensive and the worst customer service we have experienced ever!!! Absolutely not worthy for us to spent half an hour to drive from Outer Sunset to Fisherman's Wharf and paid for expensive parking to dine there and finally being turned away!!! We will never never never again return to this restaurant Sursian, will never never again to give our hard working money to support them. The customer service there were absolutely horrible."

            "This place literally has gotten a facelift. I used to go here years ago for happy hours or to meet dates for a drink. But over the years it's become more of a happening spot. I was just there a couple months ago on a Sat night. It was super packed(hardly any place to walk)Downside: it takes a while to get your drinks ordered since it's super packed and it's on the pricier side. But it's worth it.",
            "Finally finally made it here with the boyfriend on a Friday afternoon around 5:30pm. It was super packed, but I was able to snag a high-top table as people were leaving. The sun was out and we stayed for sunset. Absolutely gorgeous view! Perfect place for a post-work drink. I got the Haight- Ashberry with gin, strawberries, and citrus ($16). Yes, it was quite pricey, but so so so good! Sweet, but not overly bearing- which I think the citrus helped with. It was beautifully crafted and I absolutely loved it. My boyfriend got a local craft beer ($9) and the D'blood Orange Margarita ($16), which I tried, and was also beautifully presented and tasted good (but I liked mine better).Overall, definitely pretty pricey (we decided against food because so $$$ and the portions looked small from what we saw. Wish they had more snacks other than beer nuts- maybe like french fries), but you are paying for that view. The drinks are not watered down at all and the service is good for being so busy! Will be back!",
            "The view from THE VIEW is amazing, needless to say!  This super shwaggy restaurant and lounge is a \"must-see\" when you visit SF! The view is located in the Marriott Marquis hotel located within the Union Square neighborhood. When you enter this beautiful hotel, take the elevator up to the top floor and boom...you're there! Luckily I've visited The View Lounge on multiple occasions at different times, on different days. The best time to arrive and get a decent table is...when they open! Lol. If you're smart, make a reservation for a window seat because you will get such an amazing view of the Bay Bridge and city lights. They have self-seating lounge seats and tables near the bar, but like I said they are first come first served and once people score these tables they stay for quite a while. Hint: make a reservation. This spot is a cute date spot. If you're looking to score major first date points - come here!"

And I believe that this word is very fitting for this charming waterfront bar/restaurant.I came here recently for a quick weeknight drink with friends. The place boasted a lively crowd; the space was inviting; the staff was welcoming; and the Bay views were extraordinary. We ordered a round of cocktails which came out in a timely, efficient manner. Since we weren't staying for long, I could only glance at the food/cocktail menu (all of it looked tantalizing). I was totally seduced by this place. And just like a true flirt, I can't wait to come back and see where it leads to next.",
            "Beautiful restaurant right by the water. Service is exceptional and the food is fresh with Spanish flavors. Things that stood out were the Patatas Bravas where they are roasted and infused with garlic and rosemary and then topped with a sauce and slightly crisp to create salted crust. The grilled octopus is very fresh and works with the sauces and veggies. The chorizo is amazing!!The service is exceptional! We made a reservation and sat at the chefs counter. Everyone was very attentive and offered us a bunch of items to try!"

            "Dungeness Crab is a must-order dish. We order both Benedict and omelette and the eggs are prepared just about right. Personally I love omelette better for its soft texture. The French toast is also the best in my recent brunch experiences. Will come back again even though the wait time is almost 90 mins",
            "I know, I know, the line. Always people waiting in a line wrapped around the corner, regardless of time or day. There is often a line already before they even open, so you can't necessarily count on arriving \"early\" and being at the very front.When I wanted to see the hype and joined the rest of the jabronis in the queue, I realized it was ***cash only***. My wife held our spot in line while I walked to an ATM a couple blocks away. When I returned, we had barely moved.The food itself is good, but not great. Having a central location in a tourist neighborhood like North Beach along with the outrageous lines is enough to pique most people's curiosity. Wanna check this place out? Just embrace the suck, but understand there are other breakfast/brunch alternatives nearby that offer similar a quality.",
            "I've been here several times with in a week span. Customer service was great and although there is a wait, it was worth it for me. Very attentive, i did arrive every time about 15-30 min before they open to be seated either the first group of people. I've been there on a weekday and weekend and they always have a line.The chocolate cinnamon toast were delicious and topped with seasonal fruit. Big portion you could have two kids share or if you're really hungry.The eggs Benedict was tasteful and served with their potatoes wedges along with toast. Every bite was delicious and the portion was fairly large. The Monte Cristo was beyond my expectations. It's served with a jelly and it's toasted with ham or turkey inside. With a serving of potatoes! Pretty good highly recommend it.Their service was fast and the coffee is also good. Orange juice was also pretty good. The slice of bread with jelly is good as well."

            "If you're craving a healthy brunch/breakfast place that is also cute and homey, this is it!This place is bustling on a weekday too, but the staff has gotten the workflow down pat. Kudos to efficiency!!! There is limited patio seating outside so you\"ll likely have to wait if that's what you prefer. There is murakami-like wall art as decor - lovely touch!!! We were lucky and got seats right away on a Monday morning. There was a constant flow of customer nonetheless. We tried their famous avacados 3 ways, a savoury chicken crepe and a matcha chia pudding jar. Service was fast, efficient and friendly. The matcha chia was served first before two of our main dish, which was very thoughtful of the staff. This jar exceeded my expectations! I'm surprised this matcha chia trend hasn't caught on yet. The copious amount of fruits also adds different textures and compliments it well. Hoowever, I thought the price was a tad steep!Avacados 3 way is decent. They used different types of bread for each way, I appreciate the variety. I wish the avocado spread was thicker. On the bright side, this dish also comes with a bowl of fruit. I enjoyed the crepe very much. The toppings were generous and the sauce was delicious! Overall, I would definitely come back. I love the amount of fruits that comes with each order. Definitely try the matcha chia jar is this is your first time :)",

Also ordered a matcha latte - well-balanced and delicious.HIGHLY REC in terms of getting your money's worth!",
            "OK little breakfast/brunch spot that might be a little overrated. Don't get me wrong, the food is fine, the service was good, the location is awesome. But overall, it wasn't anything to write home about.We went as a party of four and the thing that I enjoyed the most was the freshness of their fruit bowl (which gives you an idea of how memorable their frittatas, waffles, bagels, and sides are)."

Followed up with six oysters. How the staff keeps up with the oyster orders, I will never know. I was looking at the kale salad but splurged on the squid salad. Very glad I did, the squid was fresh and delicate, not too chewy. Finally, I couldn't pass up on the rustic seafood soup. It was so good, I wiped the bowl with bread. (So wrong but so necessary)Enjoy and I will return.",
            "Line was short for a change despite the great weather. Service by Laura was terrific. Oysters were fresh and briny. Seafood Stew was hot and flavorful, the seafood cooked masterfully. Prices are not inexpensive but you do get what you pay for. Here's my whine. Just add some dungeness crab to the Seafood Stew and call it Ciopinno! And would it be too much trouble to clean the poop chute from the prawns for the stew while you're at it?",
            "Definitely one time thing for me. This seems to be a touristy thing that most locals are willing to do. Came around 5:30 and there was short line outside - yes, it moves pretty quickly. Ordered a few things to try and bill ended up being around $94 without tax. Ordered mixed oyster platter, grilled oysters, bay fries, and seafood stew. First, oysters are tiny. It comes in this huge platter and for $40, oysters are SMALL. Not really worth it. Grilled oysters also came at a steep price. $16 for 4. These were bigger, but it wasn't until I overheard another table ordering that I knew you could MIX & MATCH the grilled oysters. Well okay, thanks for telling us, waiter. 4 stars really is for the freshness of the seafood and the seafood stew itself. Favorite and most worth it dish for $24 in my opinion. Plenty of seafood, flavorful broth, super delicious and probably often overlooked by the oysters everyone comes for. Service wasn't super attentive either, as one waiter oversees all the outdoor area. Entire restaurant isn't terribly big, space could probably be optimized more."

For both of these conditions, they did not disappoint. We were seated immediately when we arrived and the restaurant was pretty clean. Not that I have anything against hole in the wall dimsum shacks, but sometimes you just want to sit down and enjoy a good dinner.The dumplings are good, but not great. I've had better soup dumplings in the past for cheaper. Even the shrimp dumplings were more dumpling, less shrimp. I liked the pancake and the chicken (which has 3 chilli signs on the menu, but is not at all spicy). The chicken comes with rice and we ordered an extra rice, but the waiter forgot to bring it with our order and by the time we got his attention we had already eaten quite a bit of the chicken and didn't need the extra rice. Basically service is not good and the restaurant is pretty loud. They have a decent wine selection and their beers on draft are quite fresh.I probably wouldn't go back unless I wanted to eat dumplings and absolutely didn't want to wait in line.",

The dimsum was alright, nothing special about it. The chicken wings were pretty good, along with the fried rice. Minus stars for service! The service was terrible. First of all, it took 15 minutes to even get one of the server's attention because they legitimately JUST WALK BY YOU AND IGNORE YOU. I came here hungry af and the service literally ruined my appetite. Also, the waitress just tossed our order onto the table and walked away hella fast."

One of the exceptions was the pork buns, where it's a bun per order. All of the food items came out to be a couple of cents over $10 (so cheap!). We were stuffed and had leftovers after our meal The dim sum were so good that we didn't miss the lack of soy sauce and satay; they were flavorful by themselves. Still dreaming about that meal. I would 10/10 recommend checking this spot out for an on-the-go meal.",
            "came here bc its rated 2nd best egg tart place in SF's chinatown! when i arrived in late afternoon, suffice to say no piping hot egg tarts were available anymore, but a line still extended far out the door for the baked delights.despite the bustling busyness, customer service was nice and i got my order (3 pineapple buns and 2 melon cakes) in a jiffy. $4 for these baked goods! they take card but cash is easier and ya get to walk out with a fresh baked bread in your happy hand. excited to come again for egg tarts!",
            "The experience here alone is enough to keep me dreaming of coming back.  There's just something about in waiting on a crowded sidewalk, cramming into the small store front, and shouting to order as you pass a wad of cash to the workers that makes walking away with $20 worth of enough dim sum to feed a village that is so truly gratifying.  In short, I felt absolutely victorious after visiting here. And that was before I even ate any of my spoils. Since the demand is through the roof, you never know exactly what will still be available by the time you get pushed to the front of the line, but I was luck enough to sample lo mein (sold by the pound!), sesame balls, shrimp dumplings, bbq pork buns, and sticky rice.  I was full before I even started eating, and loved every single bite."

            "Loved this place so much! Everything was perfect from the seafood to the noodles.  Will head straight here every time I'm in town.  It was pretty packed when we got there at 8 pm but worth every second.  Our lovely waitress recommended us the perfect dishes and the right amount of food for our small party of 3.We had the: Steamed Mussels in Garlic Infused Shrimp Broth, Grilled Unagi, Ahi Tuna, Warm Wasabi Noodles, and Deep Fried Salmon Rolls.You really can't go wrong with anything from the menu, but my favorites were the Grilled Unagi and Wasabi Noodles.  We just got 5 small plates and it was the perfect portion for 3 of us.  Everything is flavorful yet well balanced.  I loved the ambiance of the restaurant- small, intimate, and cozy.  Highly recommend. Could not rave about it enough.",
            "Summary:1. Tastes great.2. Good portion sizes for the price.3. Excellent speed of service.4. The flexibility of dessert (see below!!!) The bad:1. Need a reservation (otherwise I don't think you'll be able to get in). We came on a weekday night and it was packed.2. A bit small/cramped. Minor issue.We were seated precisely on time and ordered the following:1. Six half shell oysters (15). Extra-small, deliciously sweet, and better eaten alone without the spicy cilantro sauce. Personally, the sauce was a bit overpowering.2. BBQ ribs with slaw (17). Great taste, although I wish the meat would be a bit more tender. The slaw had a kick to it and paired well with the ribs (please see pictures!).3. Wasabi noodles and steak (26). Our first main course! This probably was my favorite dish because the steak was medium rare and the noodles were delicious. My only gripe is that I wish I could taste the fresh wasabi more (had trouble identifying it).4. Pork chop and mashed potatoes (28). Large portions and very filling. Tastes exactly how it looks (and sounds). OK, so we're pretty full at this point, but when has that ever stopped us from ordering dessert?5. The waitress informed us of a special dessert, which was a warm chocolate bread pudding with fruit. However, there was also a standard coffee ice cream, so we asked if the chef could combine the two. Voila. One of the best desserts I have had in a while. (I can't remember how much this interesting combination cost, but I do know that the table next to us, pointed at it and said, \"I'll have whatever they are having\"...lol.In all, this was a great restaurant and I would love to come back!",
            "3.5 stars, rounded down.The house is located in North Beach - an area filled with Italian food and strip clubs. The restaurant is tiny and the seats are rather cramped in a cozy, non annoying way. The decoration is mild and subtle - it seems to play well on the 'house' theme. The tables chairs and dishes are all simple and well worn, as you'd expect at a family home rather than an upscale restaurant, which adds to the homey and non pretentious vibe of the whole place.The server came and rattled off a long list of specials that, after reading other reviews, don't seem to be a special but rather just menu items that havent yet been printed on the menu. I remembered only a few from the long list so it might help to cut down the specials list, and write it down for people to be able to take it in.We ordered:Grilled unagi - this was a full eel grilled on top of what looked to be rice lightly seasoned with a wasabi mix, topped with bonito flakes. The eel is soft and the rice is also on the mushier side, which creates an overall mushy texture. Tasted good (it's rice and unagi. Never a bad combo) but found nothing notable or special. Could do with some more texture.The famous deep fried salmon - served with salmon roe on top and a side of wasabi heavy salty sauce. The dipping sauce was fantastic - enough wasabi for the wasabi lover but subtle enough for those new to it. The salmon is incredibly moist and not at all heavy. The wasabi cuts through any sense of overwhelming fat to make it just rich enough. Came with a bed of pickled red cabbage slaw. Easy to see why its a Yelp favorite.Wasabi noodles - also another Yelp favorite. This is thick noodles coated with a salty wasabi topped with sliced steak. Some others have noted the lack of a strong wasabi flavor but I thought the wasabi was just enough, and the noodles, though thick, felt like held enough flavor on their own. The steak sort of had no great place on the dish, since the noodles were so great themselves, but overall very tasty!Mushroom rice - a risotto style rice with mushrooms onions and a bunch of other vegetables topped with prawns and bonito flakes. Good, but definitely heavy. The serving is pretty huge especially for how rich it is, and personally I didn't like the texture of the mushroom or the other larger chunks of vegetable that was mixed in with the risotto.A special of the day, spicy miso cod - the presentation is funky and not sure what it's supposed to be but it was kinda cool. A chunk of cod is drowned in a umami miso sauce and topped with a funky shaped avocado roll. The cod was cooked excellently. The sauce was good but nothing complex or out of the world, and the avocado roll was also very common.Overall the food was definitely good, and on paper the dishes sound different and novel. Flavor-wise I didn't really see that.The food came out really impressively fast! The waiters were all bright and friendly, but in the five minutes after we had inhaled the food and were chatting and picking at it, waiters came up to us four times to ask if we were done yet, which made us feel reaaal rushed."

            "Good late night food to sober you up from being DRuNk, partying or getting off work if you so happen to work in the nightclub industry like I did in my 20's.SAM WOO is a historical SF spot that wasn't really touristy when I used to live there in SF. I have very fond memories of this place. This is why you should go:-It's cheap ($3.75 for rice porridge - I mean this was before 2011) -It's open late-large menu-tasty for the price: you're drunk anyways so everything tastes good at that point-quick service: and yes the server knows your drunk and you're probably obnoxious but still deals with your ass I mean, this isn't a Michelin 5 star dining experience so don't even try to compare it to that-its your local Chinese Dive hole-in-the-wall. So go get chocolate wasted and come here afterwards. Bye!",
            "Stopped by this place today for lunch. Ordered a simple Wonton Soup for $6.99. Wouldn't recommend it unless you want something flavorless. The broth literally tasted like plain water BUT the wontons were decently made. Their soup doesn't have any added vegetable in the soup (like cabbage, or chinese broccoli) like most of the other restaurants nearby. Worst part was the service though. Normally terse chinese service doesn't bother me much, but one waitress with bangs was being particularly aggressive towards me. She was super impatient with my order and kept insisting I should order more.Finally I understood why. They have a $10 card minimum, but they won't just charge you $10 if you don't have cash. I was fine with paying the $10 but she insisted I had to buy more things to get me over the $10min. I said I'd go to an ATM but then she insisted I leave my whole backpack there if I left. So bizarre and perhaps a bit racist? Either way, I wasn't going to do that with my laptop in the bag. We had a really unpleasant back & forth until I finally had to buy 2 sodas to leave. Never returning here again.",
            "As a native of New York's Chinatown, who shops/dim sums in Brooklyn's Chinatown, and now lives in the Queens Chinatown, I was pretty excited to try one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in SF's Chinatown! I met a friend here late Wednesday night and tried a little of  the duck fried rice and wonton soup (I had already eaten). The wontons are uniquely crunchy with the chestnut, and the duck fried rice was delicious! Good portion and flavor. Did I mention there was 8+ big wontons in there?! We lost count. Unfortunately we left right after a group of ten tipsy young'uns came up to the second floor, and of course they were loud and obnoxious.On my last night in SF after a long day at work, I couldn't resist ordering takeout from Sam Wo. The food via grubhub came in 30 minutes! I got the same duck fried rice and also beef tendon wonton soup. It was as good as the previous night. I saved 3/4 of the huge box of rice and 4 wontons for lunch (at the airport the next day).So all in all, yummy Chinese food, amazing portions - good to eat there if there aren't loud tipsy people. Also great for takeout orders! Will definitely eat there next time I'm in SF."

            "We were on our way to Good Mong Kok Bakery and saw a small line outside Delicious Dim Sum. We decided to make a stop and compare the dim sum from the two places. We waited about 10 minutes until we ordered. The restaurant is grab-and-go with a few tables, so most people just bought dim sum and walked away with it, which is what we did as well. Definitely a hole in the wall place!We got some har gow (shrimp dumplings), potstickers, shumai, cha siu bao, and shrimp and chive dumplings. Everything was huge and so cheap! We paid maybe $15 and fed 3 people! I will say that service was good for us because we spoke in Chinese to the woman, but I can see why service may be lacking if you speak English. Between Delicious Dim Sum and Good Mong Kok, I'd definitely prefer Delicious because Good Mong Kok had pretty rude service....see my next review.",
            "This place is good if you are trying to grab a quick bite to eat. The day I went there was a long line but it went by pretty fast. I was nervous they would be out of certain things since it was past normal lunch hour but everything was stocked well and seemed very fresh. The place itself is very small and narrow with not really any sit down and everything is put in Togo containers for you to take wherever you go. Most of the foods come in orders of 3 for about ~2$ more or less. So I was able to get 4 dishes for 10$. NOTE: if your order is under 10$ it has to be cash. I ordered: shrimp dumpling, shrimp and chives, egg rolls, and pot stickers. All was really good and kept fresh even for Togo. If you ever in the area definitely worth a try."

            "Decent Spanish restaurant in the city. My friends and I came across this restaurant in our search for a place to have lunch in the area.The atmosphere was chill and I liked the Spanish decorations around the restaurant.  We ordered the serrano croquettes, patatas bravas and the black paella. The appetizers were very mediocre. The patatas bravas were super spicy and soaked in an incredible amount of oil. I'm from Spain, and I've never seen patatas bravas served with oil. We all hate to leave food when we go out to eat, but we could not finish them. The serrano croquettes were also not my favorite. They were pretty strong and I was a bit confused trying to figure out what the filling was made of. I don't think it was bechamel based. My friends enjoyed them though. The only highlights were the black paella and the service. The paella wasn't too badly priced ($35), especially when compared with other Spanish restaurants in SF. When it first came out, I was a bit skeptical seeing how much sauce it had. However, the taste was amazing and it was very fresh. I loved the wide variety of fish that they added to the paella: mussels, shrimp, squid, clams... every bite had some fish in it. It was good to share between 3 people. The service was also really nice and attentive. Our server made sure to refill our water and also provided recommendations. I am not sure if we made the wrong dish selections, but my impression after one visit is that there are way more authentic Spanish restaurants in the Bay.",

We ordered the bouquerones, fried brussel sprouts and gambas al ajillo. It was all delicious but the shrimp (gambas al ajillo) were the real stand out. We ended the night with a complimentary aperitif.Ari was fun and sweet and made great recommendations. Will definitely be back next time we're in the city!"

It was a pop up in a local bar which I thought was such a cute idea!They rotate their menu and do themed brunches so it's nice to keep it new. But can be a let down if you're looking for something you saw on a review of to try again. They have a craft of mimosas with a variety of juices which is something I looove! I ordered the classic Benedict because I had to get one, it's in the name! They have beer cocktails as well which I also enjoyed. The service is very good. They're all so attentive. Out waitress was super sweet and recommended spots for us to check out as we were just touring the area. It's a cute, quaint little spot. Definitely one of our favorite meals of the weekend.",
            "Cute name, friendly service, and no wait on a Sunday for brunch.  Not the easiest things to achieve in SF!*Shrimply the Best - Good, just not great and not terrible.  My biggest complaint is that the dish was a bit on the room temperature side by the time it arrived at the table.  The shrimps for sure seemed to have been sitting around for a while. For the portion and SF-prices considered, it was probably a little on the overpriced side.  But still definitely worth a try.",
            "This place is a MUST if you are in SF!!!! Eggs benedict is my all time fav breakfast food when I'm out of town so naturally I looked up places on Yelp that served it. Come to find this restaurant which is perfectly named for the exact dish I was looking for! It's like it was meant to be. We called in on a Saturday morning to make reservations. Surprisingly, we were actually able to reserve a table a few hours in advance. And on a weekend! That's a plus. The parking situation was a bit difficult as it is in the city and we had to circle around a few times before finding street parking. There is a pay lot that's right across the street but we didn't opt for that at the time of our visit. The host was very friendly upon my party of 4 entering. He was inviting and got us seated right away (there was no one else waiting to be seated anyway). I was a bit shocked to see that the place wasn't packed. Especially after reading all the great reviews. I expected that they would at least have a few parties waiting for a table. But no, we got a seat right by the front door. Of course I ordered the Classic Benedict. The place is known for their Benedict's and it was what I was craving so there was no other option in mind. I'm happy to say the food was delicious! The hollandaise sauce wasn't too lemon-y like some places make it. It was a pretty good portion for paying $13. I will definitely be back here when I'm visiting SF. They really impressed me with not only their food but also their fast, friendly service as well!"

They have different seating areas such as overlooking the beach, on the patio overlooking the pier or inside. The bar service was fast and they don't skimp you on their drinks. The drinks are fairly priced averaging 10 dollars. Their Bloody Mary comes with a large shrimp, celery, & olives. It was one of the best bloody Mary's I've had.For their appetizer, we had their mussels which come with a coconut curry sauce. This combination was heaven in my mouth and was my favorite thing that I tried.My boyfriend got the seafood platter which had shrimp, calamari, fish, fries & coleslaw. Size was good and fills you up.I tried the crab and shrimp roll sandwich which was very refreshing.Tip: they validate parkingEnjoy!",
            "Eat here!I stopped in here while in SF for business. I came prepared to order a lobster roll, but couldn't resist a crab cake, glass of local wine, and a crab Louie salad. Highly recommended by the bartender. All of my food was simply amazing and perfect! The servers and staff here were very happy, playful, on point, and a pleasure to be around. When I see happy staff, I know they must have a great management team! I sat at the end of the bar(alone) but I never felt alone with these happy folks all around. There was a beautiful bay/ocean/bridge view. The crab cake was the best I've ever had. Perfect crunch, moist, delicious. The salad was huge and totally shareable. Very generous serving of perfect crab, and vegetables. Would certainly come back with the family",
            "We came here on two separate occasions on two separate days. The first time was a late night oyster and champagne run at the front bar. I feel bad for forgetting his name but there was a husky, Hispanic bartender with curly hair pulled back into a shirt pony tail who served us.  HE WAS GREAT! He up-sold us on some champagne but was so genuine and tactful that it didn't bother me at all. In fact, when we saw him at another establishment the day after, we bought him a beer. That was the first day...The second trip was completely different.  Our server was somewhat impatient and not very accommodating.  As always, we ordered oysters and champagne.  Both were par for the course so no complaints.  We also ordered garlic fries, chowder and \"Maine\" lobster tails.  The chowder was decent, not really great and not really awful.  The garlic fries were mostly garlic and whatever else makes them garlic fries with not all that much \"fries\".  They were kind of tough to eat because the garlic was so overpowering.  The lobster tails were literally the smallest I've personally ever eaten in my life. Being from the North Atlantic where these lobsters come from, I guess I'm used to a standard size when served in a restaurant but that just isn't the case here.  Beyond that, they were prepared decently well, but for the price and quality, this is not something I'd ever order again here.  The kicker for me was when the server asked me how everything was, I told her, \"Just ok. Not good not bad.\"  She was not pleased with my response and simply walked away.  For me, that was enough to leave here a tip that reflected her effort and hospitality.  All in all, the place isn't BAD.  I'd probably just order a burger or fish and chips if I ever went back.Food: 7/10Drink: 7/10Service: 5/10"

The fish did not taste like fish and fries were thick cut. Perhaps our expectations are high (we have had fish and chips in Alaska). But overall it was a decent place to have lunch. Family friendly albeit with limited seating and limited parking.",
            "I am a local. I work about 4 blocks away and have eaten at The Codmother many times.Wonderful place to have authentic fish and chips. Here's why:1. Owner is very friendly and welcoming to everyone, locals and tourists.2. Great value. You WILL be satisfied with a regular fish & chips, shrimp & chips or combo.3. Every utensil is recyclable. This is a VERY responsible SF establishment.4. Everything is made fresh. You may need to wait a few minutes, especially when they're busy, but it's worth the wait. The quality is OUTSTANDING and it's ALWAYS fresh.5.It's all outside, but there's plenty of seating. There are some large tables, so be prepared to make some new friends. I personally love that environment.Kudos to a well run business with excellent food at good prices and with friendly owners/staff. A rarity in the Bay Area these days."

Little did I know that it was first come, first serve outside, so don't waste your time like I did. Grab a chair while you can. They serve complimentary bread and leave a pitcher of water on the table. No frills, which I actually prefer anyway. Inside is quaint and harder to get a table. We had the clam chowder, risotto & shrimp and scallops mixture. They were all divine! So good. The risotto was hands down the best I've had in the city (best ever being in beautiful Venizia), seafood was very fresh. This is my new favorite place for all things seafood.

            "Be prepared to wait!! We arrived around 7pm on a Saturday (probably dinner rush) and was told that the wait would be around an hour 20 minutes for two. They ran out of pagers so they told us to just come back in an hour to get seated. We went next door to Pete's to grab a drink while we waited and went back to check-in again an hour 15 minutes later. We were then told that it'll be another 20 minutes. After 20 minutes went by, we were told it will be another 15. At that point we had already waited for 2 hours and the food just wasn't worth the wait. We ended up just asking to sit outside since the tables were unoccupied and everyone else seemed to be waiting for a table inside. We ordered the cioppino, crab diavolo, and 4 oysters (2 west coast, 2 east coast) and 2 raw clams. The oysters and clams were fresh but on the smaller side, comes with a marinara type sauce. The cioppino was a big portion, but I wouldn't call it \"The Best Damn Cioppino in SF\". There was a lot of seafood no doubt, but the soup itself was quite bland and I didn't like all the penne pasta that was included. The crab diavolo (half order of crab over linguine) was okay, the crab was delicious but the pasta was dripping in oil. We ended up dipping some of our bread in the oil which turned out pretty yummy. Overall, I don't think the food was justified by the amount of time we waited. If you visit, I suggest coming with a group of 3 or more so you can make a reservation beforehand.",
            "The good, the bad and the ugly. Good-Seafood for the most part. Wait staff is top notch. Bad- No creativity in their dishes. Example- all the pasta dishes are plain-Jane. Pasta with heavy cream based butter sauce. Not much garlic, and too thick. Pesto was an overdose and needed a little thought by the chef. The chef needs to taste all the pasta sauces and they'll find that they need to add something to break the heavy buttercream sauce even cherry tomatoes in the pesto would've been perfect for that dish. My fettuccine with the scallops was basically as simple as it sounds. My wife's seafood fettuccine was bland.The UGLY-THE WAIT, EVEN WITH RESERVATIONS.The lack of ventilation. Has to be very unhealthy for everyone. My Daughters couldn't eat because they got over-heated. Super UGLY- Red wine served WARM! What? Yes served warm. Plus my glass was not washed and absolutely gross. Crusty all over the rim and base. They didn't charge me and I appreciated it. Thank you. Advice-We should've taken the hint from the Uber driver when he mentioned that we should eat seafood out of town and not at a tourist destination. We will listen next time."

            "5 spice chicken bahn mi sammich  Got a great discount using my Ritual App, Went after the main lunch rush and got a yummy well made sandwich. Rest of their menu looks worth a try as well. Will check out again",
            "Definitely an upgrade from the steam table Chinese-American fast food that was here before.  Everything seems freshly made to order.  The quality isn't as good as joints in Little Saigon or even Out The Door a few blocks away though.  It's still better than a boring generic salad / soup / sandwich place, which is way too prevalent in the FiDi lunch scene.Fresh Spring Roll w/ Buttermilk Chicken & Avocado: When ever I see \"chicken\" and \"buttermilk\", I think fried chicken.  Unfortunately, I learned that the word \"fried\" was omitted because it was indeed not fried.  But, thankfully, it ended up being tender and tasty.  The roll itself was made fresh to order and you could tell because the rice paper was nice and supple.  Very large portion too.Imperial Roll: These were probably the best item I tried.  Super crispy shell with a dense meaty flavorful center.  When wrapped in lettuce with some noodles and dipped in the sauce, so delicious!  Kinda filling though, so definitely split this else you won't be able to finish your main course.Garlic Noodles w/ Filet Mignon: Sounded better on paper.  The garlic noodles weren't as good as An the Go / Crustacean.   Kinda like lo mein noodles that happened to have garlic and soy.  The filet mignon seemed well done and was missing any sort of nice sear, gray all around.  It was cheaper than a typical filet mignon dish, so I suppose my expectations can't be too high.Pho Noodle Combo: Had to get my favorite trio (steak, beef balls, brisket) and hold the tendon.  It was a good sized bowl.  The broth was kinda middling.  Not bad, but definitely not worth a special trip.  It had a bit too many noodles for my taste, making it too starchy of an experience.  Similarly, seemed a bit sparse on the meat.",
            "I work not too far from here, and saw the reviews so I figured I'd check it out.Being Vietnamese myself, and seeing that it was a family run place - I kind of had high expectations for this place. I got the Shrimp Vermicelli Bowl, and I have to say - I was IMPRESSSED!! They give you a good amount of sauce which I love because I usually ask for 2 sauces at most places, but here it is not needed. The egg rolls were nice and crunchy, and the carrots were a nice size thickness with lots of flavor. I'm very excited to come back and try other things. My only complaint would be some of their prices. I wanted to order the spring rolls, but they were $7!! So I opted not to."

            "What a Great combination of Chinese and Japanese food Z & Y Bistro has!  From the Yakitori to the Ramen to the spicy dumplings to the sautéed Pea sprouts with garlic, we were very impressed with the explosion of tastes, attentive and friendly service, and variety of options available here. Visiting from out of town, my main goal was to find a good unique and flavorful meal for the family. This place hit it on the spot. Most Japanese places have sushi, bento boxes, noodles, and rice bowls, but it's hard to find good Yakitori...until you come here. We booked a table for 5 (3  adults, 2 kids) and everyone raved about each dish that came out.  We were in SF for 6 days and the meal we had here was the best we had during our entire trip (after consulting Yelp and selecting 4 other top rated places).  I cannot wait to go back.I'd recommend getting a reservation if you can.--------TL;DR--------PROS: Everything we had here was great! I'd recommend the yakitori miso pork and the asparagus beef. The bacon wrapped tomato was maybe my least favorite but still excellent.CONS: luckily we got a reservation but as we left we saw several people waiting. It might get tough to get a table on a busy night.  Don't get this place confused with Z&Y Restaurant, down the street.BOTTOM LINE: definitely a fun and delicious experience here--I can't wait to come back to SF for another visit",
            "Came for lunch around 11:45 with 3 others on a Thursday and it was pretty empty. I called and made reservations the day before, but I really didn't need them.Z & Y Bistro is relatively new and is owned by the same owners as Z & Y Restaurant, which is right across the street. Unless its sister restaurant which is smaller and more dingy, the bistro has a nicer ambiance with modern decorations and a lot more space to walk around.The menu here, while it features some of the spicy dishes that the original restaurant is known for, also has an interesting variety of other dishes, ranging from appetizers to hot pot to skewers to soup noodles.We ordered a couple dishes to share:Chicken thigh skewers ($7.95) - just okay. The meat was a little bland. Would skip this unless you really like chicken thighChicken wing skewers (($7.95) - could use more salt and pepper but otherwise good. I liked how they cut the chicken wing in half and then stuck it on the skewerMiso pork skewers ($7.95) - the group favorite! The pork was mildly sweet and tenderLanzhou ramen ($12.95) - non-spicy noodle soup. Comes with slices of beef and perfectly cooked noodles in a beef bone broth Chongqing spicy noodle ($10.95) - didn't try any because it was spicy but my friends really enjoyed thisChicken with chili pepper ($18.95) - also didn't try this, but it was recommended by our server as one of their most popular dishes. Looked similar to the same dish at Z & Y Restaurant",
            "Here for a quick weekday dinner. TLDR: nice ambiance and good service for authentic chinese food! Ambiance: trendy and modern, unlike your typical chinatown placesService: decentFood: Skewers (4/5) - we had the duck breast and chicken liver and both were delicious but pricey Bamboo shoots (3/5) - portion on the small side but flavor is okaySizzling spicy fish (4.5/5) - super tender silky fish balanced with spice and flavorBeef pot (4/5) - a little too sweet for me but very heartyLanzhou beef noodle (5/5) - this was AMAZING. Excellent chewy noodles and authentic soup base. And fairly priced.Overall a great traditional pricey chinese food place in a modern setting"

            "Lovely place. Lovely people. But most importantly, lovely food! Seriously, I'm so glad I live one minute away from this new gem in North Beach. They've been open for less than a month but I've been here about five times already. I always get the wet burrito with carne asada, Spanish rice, pinto beans, and their super yummy (and spicy!) habanero sauce. The burrito is HUGE and I get two meals out of it.Their chips and guac are delicious as well. The interior is spacious and they have quite a few tables for a small North Beach restaurant. For the price and quality, you really can't beat this place. Would absolutely recommend Adolfo's, come check it out!",
            "I was disappointed by my first (and probably only) meal at Adolfo's. I stopped by on my way home because I was craving a burrito and the food looked good from the photos on Yelp. When I walked in, there was only one person in front of me. Even still, it took almost ten minutes before someone took my order. Things behind the counter seemed very disorganized. After I placed my order (a vegetarian burrito with guacamole), it took another ten minutes for them to make my food. The burrito cost almost $14 before tax and tip, but came with free chips. When I first bit into the burrito, I was surprised to find that it was filled with random grilled vegetables, like green beans, lettuce, and mushrooms. I've never had mixed veggies in a burrito before. I ate about half of the burrito, and never got a guacamole bite. The beans and Spanish rice were good, but the rest of it was just too out there. Maybe I should have stuck to a chicken burrito? Either way, I'm still hungry.",

            "I had trouble finding this place until I realized this place was literally a little window connected to the side of a building. I came at around 11:15 am on a Friday afternoon and was told in-person orders would start at 11:30. Apparently, a lot of people do pre-orders online. I should have ordered online since it was 11:15, but I didn't this about it.I ordered Banh Mi ($9) with Coconut Milk Fried Chicken ($2). The banh mi was super crunchy! I felt like I was making a huge mess with the crumbs. It looked like the pigeons were waiting for the right moment to grab the bread crumbs.I was given a lot of pickled veggies and they tasted really fresh. I was glad the sandwich wasn't too saucy. If I could pick up my sandwich without it dripping all over my hands, it's a good sign! The chicken did not taste like coconut milk and it was only slightly crispy. It was not really warm but it could be because it was super cold and I was eating outside under the shade. There are only a few tables near this place. This place is a little costly, but I will probably come back in the future.",
            "The Little Window is located on the side of the building I work in and everytime I go outside there is a HUGE line. So when I wandered out and there was no line, I took it as a sign from the gods. And they didn't lead me wrong! This place is bombbbb- I tried their Vermicelli Noodle Bowl with Tofu as my protein and I ate every last bite. Not to mention I waited less than 2 minutes for my meal so it was the perfect meal for my thirty minute lunch break. (This makes me assume the line goes by pretty fast!) Since then, I have tried the Avocado Toast with a Poached Egg and the Matcha Latte and I am a devoted fan. Pro tip- they give you 10% off if you bring your own bowl or mug!",
            "I've eaten food from little window a couple times since it's the closest Vietnamese food I could get around where I work. This place operates out of a fricken window so I'm not sure why the food is so expensive. Just to be clear, I was never expecting any authenticity when I came in but I do expect a tasty food for the prices they charge. I've tried their grilled pork banh mi sandwich, rice bowl, & honey latte. The latte is AMAZING!! I am actually excited about trying the other drinks cuz the honey latte is so bomb. However, the food here is not worth it! The pork in my banh mi had no flavor and neither did the coconut fried chicken or curry chicken in my rice bowl. The banh mi tastes mostly like the do chua rather than the meat. There could definitely be some improvement in the seasoning as well as the proportions of meat in the sandwich. The sandwich also comes with sriracha mayo instead of the traditional butter/pate which didn't really bother me but might be a turn off to some. When it comes to the rice bowls, the one thing I like is that it comes with brown rice without extra charge but only cuz I love brown rice. I don't know why people are so hyped up about the coconut fried chicken...it was like lukewarm when I got it and the breading was soggy while the meat was dry. Maybe I got an old batch? Even so, the seasonings were not there. The chicken curry was better than the coconut fried chicken but also lacked flavor. Also it's outrageous that they charge $6 for one spring roll that is cut in half. I feel so bad for the people who decide to buy spring rolls here because they deserve better. Please love urself!I recommend this place for the drinks but not for the food."

            "The one star reviews here for the reason are crazy, don't be so entitled. This place has been around since the 60's, they bring in fish straight from the bay. We waited at the bar about 30 minutes before the table was ready (they have live wait times). The bartender was super friendly and the ambiance was nice! Once seated we enjoyed a nice starter and entree. It was really good and fresh! Definitely not like the tourist seafood joints surrounding this jewel. If you're entitled there are many other seafood restaurants at pier 39. If you want fresh seafood with Italian twist, go here!",
            "Scoma's serves Pacific seafood, caught on small boats, and brought to the pier by local fishermen. They also offer a full bar program with premium crafted cocktails and an extensive award-winning wine list to complement your meal. If you plan on driving, there is free valet service at the door. It all started with six stools and their mother's recipes...In 1965, when brothers Al and Joe Scoma heard about a small coffee shop on the Wharf that was for sale, they had no idea that they were about to create a landmark restaurant. The brothers bought the tiny coffee shop on Pier 47, serving coffee and burgers to local fishermen and shortly thereafter, started expanding.  A savvy businessman who prided himself on going above and beyond, Al  turned a hidden local hangout into one of the nation's highest grossing independent restaurants in a very short time.Al Scoma always believed in working hard, enjoying life and being the best in the business. His restaurant operating experience began in the late 1950s as one of the original six partners in Castagnola's Restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf.  Although he loved the restaurant business, he discovered the difficulty of making efficient, expedient decisions with six partners.  So, with his purchase of a humble café in 1965, Al found an outlet for all the business and life lessons he had learned.  In no time, Al built Scoma's into a landmark restaurant and was always in the front of the house to greet locals, visitors, sports stars, celebrities and anyone who walked through the door. Gracious to all, welcoming guests to his restaurant as he would his home, Al believed that everyone was special and deserved the best food and the best service when they dined at Scoma's.From the beginning, Al forged and nurtured relationships with local fisherman and by 1979, he purchased a 46-foot fishing boat that continues to be used and licensed for the annual salmon and crab seasons.  The local fishermen always knew they had Al's support, whether offering a hot cup of coffee at the restaurant after a hard day's work or purchasing their catch directly.In 1993, with the \"pier to plate\" concept in mind, Al built Scoma's its own fish receiving station.  Dedicated to his brother and co-founder Joe, the station permits public viewing of wild salmon and local Dungeness crab as it is off-loaded from boats and prepared for the kitchen.Newsweek Magazine recognized Scoma's for having one of the best clam chowder recipes in the country (Jan. 10, 2005). And Al was quoted as saying, \"We let our food speak for itself.\"Believing in family being the root of a successful business, Al enlisted daughters, nieces, nephews and, his son-in-law Tom Creedon (who is now President of Scoma's) to build his business and carry on his legacy.  When not at the restaurant, he could be found cheering on his beloved San Francisco Giants and Forty Niners or out on the golf course.  Al Scoma died in June 2007 of natural causes surrounded by his loved ones. He is survived by his three daughters and his wife Cheryl. His name and restaurant continue to be recognized worldwide.Located on Al Scoma Way. Valet parking is fast, simple and smooth. Peak wait time can be up to 30 minutes. Reservations strongly recommended or you can opt to wait at the bar. Impeccable service and amazing attention to detail. Highly recommended. The food is good but the staff is totally off the hook! The grilled calamari is fantastic and the salmon plate is amazing!",
            "Probably our favorite spot among many highlights of a Bay Area vacation. Escape the bubba gump blues of fisherman's wharf, and enter this secluded haven of quality dining and service. You have to find it! It's hidden! But worth it! The decor is classic marina-side dining: wood, glass, and plush. The food is fresh and interesting. We loved the salmon bruschetta and the dungeness crab roll (think north east lobster roll sandwich, but with west coast crab meat). The servers are pros. They know the menu, they know the business of serving, and they are attentive and prompt. A great afternoon lunch!"

Prices are your typical SF rates, around $10+ depending on what you add? Creative Grilled Cheeses you can order. I love their hot sauce, became so obsessed that I looked up where they sell it. Palo Alto Fire Fighters Hot Sauce.They have a fictional bathroom. Families are encouraged to dine here. We came with 2 little kids. I would go back.",

            "What does it say about me as a human being -- as an American! -- that my very favorite restaurant happens to feature grilled cheese as its primary dish? I shall leave aside that relevant question for now and focus solely on how totally freaking awesome this particular version of America's favorite sandwich is. WOW! I always get the mousetrap -- the Platonic ideal of a grilled cheese. It's elemental -- just bread and cheese and deliciousness. My nephew went big -- got a grilled cheese with macaroni and cheese. Friendly staff, totally clean operation, help yourself to water (a perk I always enjoy, but especially in this environment of soda taxes and sales taxes). This is that rare restaurant for which a magical sixth star should be an option, both to reward its awesomeness and also to offset the jerks and meanies who give it one star for no good reason (or for obnoxious reasons). Like how about this one: \"the food is too expensive.\" Read the newspaper! Small businesses in San Francisco -- throughout California, actually -- are getting KILLED by regulations and pass-along costs. You can't turn around and blame the place that's struggling to employ people!!! OK, rant over, back to the matter at hand. Which is that AGCK is amazing and everyone should eat there."

            "Great experience here. We came the week it opened so it was busy with even a wait on Friday at 1030pm. However, the staff was extremely generous and we could tell they were working hard to get us seated. We waited in the bar where we were served generous pours. Once we got our table the waitress was so helpful going into extreme detail regarding which salads to choose and she heavily recommended the wings.The picture doesn't look like much but they were mouth-watering. Cooked perfect, great flavor, very unique. The salad was a bit too salty for our liking but i feel it was the style given the anchovy. Still ate it all - though this may have been where I would deduct .5 from my score. We also ordered pizza which was great. I don't think you can go wrong with fiorella pizza of any type. A definite repeat. Great add to the neighborhood (and replacement).",
            "I was so excited for this to open in the neighborhood, Russian Hill needs more good eats.I made reservations and when I got there, the restaurant was packed. I was seated right by the door. Servers and customers knocking into my me. Plus it was freezing, so do not sit by that one table near the host station/door. Aside from that, service was slow. We sat there for about 15 mins and no one gave us water or even say hi. I know they were slammed but still. Ordered: **Nono's Meatballs - the sauce was super yummy. **Bucatini alla Pomodoro - needed more flavor, my friend did not like it as well. Wasted calories one would say. Presentation was awful. Sauce all over the bowl, inside and out. Seems like they just threw pasta into it and didn't care. **Clam Pie - the crust was so good, thin and light, just the way I like my pizzas. Can't taste much clam but it was still tasty. **Stracciatella Semifreddo - first time having it, not bad. Ice cream kinda of bar/fudge texture. Overall food was ok, service was nice but slow. I will hopefully come back and hope things get better. But I am excited to try their brunch when they start offering it.",
            "Came in for Fiorella for dinner, luckily it was on open table, upon hearing the hype in the richmond district. The ambience was very mediocre. There was no enough space for people to walk so whenever someone walked by we would always have to move our seat to let them by. Secondly, there is a funky smell while entering which should be fixed immediately.The food it self met expectations. I would definitely come back for their pasta and pizza! As for the service however, it took almost 20 minutes to bring our dessert our! I believe this is due to new staff. I am sure as time goes on they will get better.I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a romantic date spot if you live near by."

            "A great under-the-radar happy hour spot! Happy hour is offered Mon-Fri 3-6 pm and includes a good selection of food and cocktails. All of their cocktails, regularly priced at $13, are $9 during happy hour.My friend and I made a reservation for 5:30 on a Friday and the restaurant was pretty empty when we walked in. Our server started out by bringing us bread and complimentary garlic potato chips and spiced nuts. The bread is really soft, but the butter is pretty salty so use it sparsely.They had 3 daily pizzas available for happy hour. We went the margherita for $14. It's thin crust, probably 10-12 inches, and great for 2-3 people to share.We also ordered the brussel sprouts ($7). They were delicious with the pancetta, though I would've liked for sprouts to be more crispy and less soft.As far as drinks go, I started off with the Jamaican Breeze (rum, pressed pineapple, lime, vanilla), which tasted like pineapple juice, i.e. it was nice and sweet. I also ordered the Maryunez (yuzu infused gin, sweet vermouth, maraschino, bitters) as well, but I didn't like it as much because it was very strong on the gin and I couldn't taste any yuzu or cherry flavors which I was expecting. I had to slowly sip on this.The service here is great! Our server was very attentive in checking in with us occasionally, and my water glass was never empty for long. We were here for 3.5 hours slowly drinking and chatting and there was absolutely no pressure to leave. I really appreciated that.",
            "Came here on a rainy night with reservations for 7:30.  The place was packed and our table wasn't ready so we grabbed a drink at the bar.  We ended up having to wait 30 minutes but the hostess was extremely apologetic and our drinks at the bar were comped, so no big deal.  We split the meatballs, I had the lemon pasta, and my bf had the sedanini.  GET THE SEDANINI.  It looks like a giant pasta souffle and it's steamy and comforting and warm and delicious.  Service was good and I enjoyed my meal here.  I'd come back!"

            "Beautiful ambiance, amazing food and hospitality. Make reservations well in advance if you need a specific time and date. We were very lucky to be able to make reservations late at night (a week in advance) after arriving from the airport, and they were very gracious in accommodating us. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, and I would recommend wearing business casual or something more formal than jeans. As a vegetarian I had a lot of options to choose from and particularly enjoyed the saghanaki, zucchini cakes, gigantes, and galaktoboureko for dessert. It was all very delicious and can't wait to come back again to try more dishes and order a bottle of wine next time!",
            "The food here can be pretty amazing, but some of it was a sore disappointment! If you order right, it can be overall a great dinner. RESERVATIONS: Made a week or two in advance on Open Table. THE SERVICE: Very professional and friendly. We had our 7-month-old and several staff were very charming with her!THE COST: $424.85 before tips, for a big dinner for 5. Pricey! Worth a nice occasion.THE FOOD: MEZETHES* Kolokithokefhethes (crispy zucchini cakes, $12.25) - 4 starsLove the crispy breading surrounding the soft zucchini! Great in the cold mint yogurt dressing.* Saghanaki (pan fried cheese, $16.50) - 3 starsFreshly fried, & you get a nice thick layer of crunch. Just not very interesting for me personally - a hunk of fried cheese sitting in its own oil without many accompanying flavors.* Hirino (pork belly, $15.25) - 3 starsI remember the meat being quite tough and just not very tasty.KIRIOS PIATO* Kotopoulo Souvlas (rotisserie chicken, $29.25) - 2 starsI didn't try this but my friend really didn't seem to enjoy it - she couldn't finish the dish and didn't ask for the leftovers!* Arnisia Paidakia (lamb chops, $47.50) - 4.5 starsAmazing! Juicy, with brilliant flavors. But also.. so pricey! Otherwise would be 5 stars.* Arnisia Souvlaki (lamb skewer, $38.25) - 3 starsMy partner wasn't too impressed with this. The meat was tender, but it had a lot of fat & cartilage to pick around.* Goat Stew ($45) - 3.5 starsA special of the night, the orzo was a perfect accompaniment to the rich chunks of goat. FYI there is cartilage - the meat is not 100% lean - but I am used to that in Chinese cooking! This had a slightly sweet flavor. The price point is pretty high, otherwise I'd rate this 4.5 stars.GLYKA* Galaktoboureko (custard in filo, $10.75) - 3 starsThe filo dough was a little soggy. FYI the custard had a slight savory/sour taste - can't quite describe it, but it's not purely sweet if that's what you're looking for. I liked the unique flavor though wasn't expecting it.* Loukoumades (greek doughnuts, $10) - 4 starsSoft filling, lightly crisped on the outside, great for sharing!* Kataifi (off menu, crispy filo pastry, $12) - 4 starsCrispy on the bottom, rich creamy custard (though not too heavy) on the top. Flavored with honey, pistachio. All amounts to a great dessert!",
            "Brought my parents and some family members here for a lunch and it was awesome. We were celebrating two birthdays and they accommodated us so well for about 10 people. Serving sizes are on the smaller side but the food altogether was very delicious. Service was impeccable and food came out very timely. Remember this is the city so be mindful about arriving early to find parking. We came during the lunch hour and though the restaurant wasn't too busy the surrounding area was."

First day in SF we ate at the place next to the hotel, it was just ok. Was told to try this place, which was only like a block away. we went every morning we were there.Pancakes were fluffy and huge, so tasty. French toast was amazing and the eggs were great as well. bacon & sausage were also top notch. id deff slso suggest ordering the fruit bowl. lol its more like a fruit bucket! its huge full of super fresh fruit, was just great. yes you may need to wait for a seat so either get there early or be patient cause its worth it. the inside isnt much to talk about so i wont, but its the food your going for, so if your in SF you need to get to this place for Breakfast, there is no other place worth going to.",
            "We returned to Hollywood Cafe over a quick trip to SF.  I don't know if the owners changed but the service, quality of food and service sure did.  The menu items were very overpriced compared to what you got.  I ordered the bacon and eggs with scrambled egg whites, smoked bacon and asked them for a side of tomatoes and to hold the toast and hash browns.  My husband ordered the CAB omelette and asked to substitute one pancake for the hash browns and toast.  We were told no on both requests because 'the toast is complimentary'.  I simply asked for sliced tomatoes which they have in their omelette so why couldn't I get that as a side?   And we were willing g to pay extra for a pancake.   Also, the toast is not complimentary because we paid $31 for breakfast which included toast as a menu item.  The service was just okay which was a bummer because we were looking forward to a repeat of our previous 5-star review.",
            "This is a solid breakfast spot in SF. Just like most of the other good breakfast/brunch spots, you can expect a line to form rather quickly if you're not the early bird getting the worm. The staff here is really good and the food came out pretty fast. The decor was cozy, definitely not a place you dress up to come to. If you're looking for a long breakfast to sit and hang out, this is probably not the best spot because they're busy and try to politely get you out so someone else can have a table, which is understandable.For food, I tried the avocado toast with fresh fruit. My plate was good, but lacking a little flavor. I didn't realize there was an accompanying spread on the plate until I was just about done eating, so that's my fault. The fruit was an excellent assortment and everything tasted freshly cut and ripe. My boyfriend had  the chilaquiles, which he found to be pretty good. Big portions and good service. Def worth visiting."

            "Back at Wayfare again! This time we were seated upstairs which was quite lovely and intimate. The food is delicious as always. We ordered the housemade mint lemonade - so refreshing. The mac and cheese and the charred little gems paired really well with the fried chicken. Service is impeccable as always!",
            "Hmmm.  Wayfare is a Great Atmosphere and High Energy Tavern! The hostess was an amazing friendly young lady.  She worked hard to find us a table and we were seated as promised in 15 minutes. Little entry bar is small, minimal seats, and only had one very busy bartender.  Hard to get a drink when you are competing against the entire tavern. But still worth the stop if you are waiting on a table. We had a cool table upstairs and received menus quickly. Support team was great - bread/water/etc. but our server (Enrique) was too busy (apparently) and had trouble with a few items throughout the night. After waiting 15 mins for a table drink, I received the wrong bourbon. They offered to dump it and get me what i ordered but was nice and said it was ok. *then i discovered it was something rare and $27 on the rocks. WOW. Apparently Wayfare Tavern is known for their Fried Chicken. Top Ten Fried Chicken in the US (it advertises and its in the menu). Two members ordered it and unanimous decision was \"Not that great\" - both left it on the table. We also tried Salmon and the Pork Chop.  Both were good, but nothing memorable. Another service item was the waiter forgot our sides - never noticed, never apologize, just went back (after we were almost done) and dropped them off.  I also saw another party that had to grab the manager to get a wine list - as no one showed up to wait on them.Atmosphere was great, hostess is best in town, but the service is poor and food average.  Almost got the vibe that the staff didn't care, given the place was packed. No apology or offer to take off the wrong drink / sides. May try it again in a year or so, but not a favorite or recommendation right now. Thanks Hostess - family appreciated you.",
            "Service was friendly but disorganized. Timings on dishes coming out and servers coming by was a little off.Popover was a little dry, went great with butter, but the butter was over salted.Burrata was ok, not what I expected but suitable.The famous fried chicken was really disappointing. I wouldn't call it fried chicken - it was more of a half baked half fried chicken. Drumstick and wings were tender but the breast was dry. It lacked soul."

Multitasking by running the servers, taking orders, and restocking the Dim Sum. Very straight forward and knows the menu by heart.I would recommend to anyone who want to grab a quick bite or to go orders. My wife and I enjoyed it! Coming back next time we go by the area!",
            "You can get your tasty dim-sum morsels without the sit down experience of a dim sum restaurant by going to take out places.  There are many places in Chinatown you can go, but there are some that are better than others. If you know that place on Stockton St, you know that there's always a waiting line that stretches out the door. Dim Sum Bistro is the latest take-out dim sum business to occupy this location. The prior establishments' offerings were nothing that wowed you. I've been coming here for the sticky chicken rice that's wrapped in bamboo leaves.  Very similar to the Chinese tamale or joong.  Eating one makes a good meal with the tasty chicken filling encased by the sweet sticky rice. Each time I visit, the line is always getting longer. So that it is a good sign the overall dim sum offerings here are very good.  I will have to try some of the other dim sum items next time.  Service is pretty good. The ladies speak and understand English as I see them servicing non-Chinese speaking customers without difficulty.   With reasonable prices and tasty dim sum, I'll be back more often.",
            "Came in on a Sunday as part of my \"dim sum sunday\" tradition. It was raining outside, so we wanted a place that was bakery-style but still had a few tables to sit down and enjoy our dumplings. We arrived around 1ish and there was a line. I waited for about 10-15 minutes in line as everyone zipped around pointing at dumplings, speaking in languages I didn't understand, scanning some sort of coupon/discount barcode I couldn't read, and paying in cash (they take credit card but cash was  much faster). It was great and definitely felt authentic. I filled out a little order sheet of paper to avoid any language barriers-- 3 of that, 1 of that.. and watched as the shocked ladies behind the counter began to stack our dumplings. Ok, I might have over-ordered. For under $40, 3 of us feasted on the largest buns and the largest siu mai I've seen (that come in beef too!). They even gave us free egg rolls...before telling us \"now no more ordering for a while\" :P Everything was delicious and huge, and we all had leftovers for the next day. Will definitely come back!"

            "Solid 4 stars.  At first they asked us to go next for because they had a long wait and we're gag a okay of 6... to their sister restaurant Perbacco. We checked it out but didn't want to go there so they were actually accommodating because they made room to seat us at the bar,  although we had to sit separately. The server seemed a little annoyed we wanted separate checks (business trip) but nicely did it was not a problem. He helped out my colleague with her menu choice since she has a gluten allergy.  That was good. I ordered sparkling water - good,  from Italy. The so of the day - potato leek - DELICIOUS,  please try out if you like potato.  Keep in mind,  it is not chunky if that's what you're looking for.  Orecchiette  pasta  with fennel sausage and broccoli - very good! I would recommend asking foot some red outdoor flakes to complement the dish.  Overall,  if I'm  in the area, I would come back but definitely would like to try other places in SF!",
            "I really want to give this place a better review, especially since the service and the venue are both spectacular, but the food definitely brings the rating to a 3. The staff are SO nice! We came a bit early for our reservation, and the hosts were very friendly and happily took us to our seats early. The restaurant is super small, and we ended up sitting at the counter. I would highly recommend a reservation if possible. As for the food, it was somewhat of a miss for me. We ordered the ricotta bruschetta, and the bread was way too crunchy for me, and I couldn't really taste the flavor of the ricotta. I also got the tagliatelle bolognese and my friend got the cavetali. The tagliatelle noodles were well made, but there wasn't enough sauce and the sauce itself was very bland. The Cavetali had a really delicious lamb sausage added to it, but the noodles were a let down. They were very undercooked, and tasted like hard, rounds of dough. I have definitely had better pasta, unfortunately, but if you really want italian food and this place is nearby, I might come again. But definitely go for the tagliatelle and skip the cavetali.",
            "We came here on Valentine's Day for an early lunch with no reservations and they were able to seat us at the counter, which is where we preferred anyway. If you want table seating, make reservations, because they fill up quickly. The Barbacco staff are nice, attentive, efficient, and quick, which is everything you hope and wish for when you go out to lunch during work hours. You can tell that they have thought service through and it makes a difference. We started with the Butternut Squash Bruschetta, which had apples, arugula, and saba. The bread was crispy and the squash with the apples created creamy goodness. Taste buds were extremely happy. Moving on to our entrees, I had the Orrechiette pasta, which had sausage, broccoli, pecorino cheese, and my husband had the Fettucine alla Bolognese. You could really taste and appreciate the homemade sauces and pasta. Portion sizes were perfect and we left feeling full but not overstuffed. We'll be back for sure!"

            "I've had this place on my mind for a while and actually had brunch reservations planned for later this month when my friend chose this place for lunch- I'm so glad he did! We came in at 2:20 on a Thursday and they close on weekdays at 2:30 to prep for dinner so we were forced to order quickly. The service was super attentive and we ordered quite a bit. The portions here are not lacking for sure. Tried:1. Kobe Beef noodles - 3.5/52. Pork Tacos - 5/5 I don't like pork but this was incredible. 3. Poke - 5/5 fresh ahi tuna, so good. Even the crackers were special and really brought out the flavor of the poke.4. Cucumbers - 4/5 basic cucumbers but had nice vinegary flavor with a good amount of sesame seeds Definitely not the place if you prefer super authentic Chinese but either way it's a great modern twist (nothing too spicy btw) I don't think you could go wrong here! Can't wait to come back for brunch",
            "AVOID THIS PLACE!!!I have a food allergy to spicy ingredients. My wife and I called ahead and were told they could accommodate. Upon ordering I was assured the chicken teriyaki was safe. They delivered my wife's food and informed me that I couldn't have the dish and there wasn't anything on the menu that I could eat. So I sat there and watched my wife eat dinner and they charged us full price. AVOID THIS PLACE!",
            "Meh... Short story: decent food but overpriced, unique drinks, tiny tables, incredibly slow service, 90s-2000's hip hop, get there when it opens or make reservations.Incredibly small tables really take away from the atmosphere which is pretty cool in and of itself. The place is small and fills up quickly. They did not let a party of 2 sit in a 4 person booth during my visit.The food is decent but definitely not worth the price they charge. To be fair here, the skyrocketing SF rents have put a lot of good places out of business. Given the size of this place they probably have to charge that much to keep the lights on. I also was irritated at how slow they were. I grew 3 beards, lost my hair, teeth, and eyesight before my food arrived. Staff is very friendly but very slow. It's worth checking out but I wont be back for a second trip."

            "Your typical hole in the wall pub food joint serving up a greasy array of burgers, sandwiches, fries appetizers and salads. The staff was friendly for our afternoon weekday lunch. A couple stray Giants fans were there for pregame festivities as well as businesspeople from the nearby warehouse district offices. Your best best here is a cold beer and a burger, however neither of those were on my wishlist (pescatarian and a lot of work sitting back at my desk). I ordered an iced tea to drink which was constantly refilled by the waitress. Our group started with mozzarella stick appetizers and potato skins. Both were a hit but nothing spectacular. For lunch I went with the grilled salmon salad. The portion size was very large but the salad was very blah. Lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, grilled salmon with the skin on, and balsamic vinaigrette. Flavor was lacking on the fish and I wish the salad would have had avocado, cheese, and or some summer fruit. It is served on a large plate but the salad was easy to finish as it was mainly just lettuce. Those who ordered bacon cheeseburgers at my table were much more satisfied and they could barely choke down half of their meal without loosening the belt buckles. Don't come here for the food, come here for the environment and to drink beer. A great sports bar. On the plus side, it's open for private events if you want to rent out the entire space.UPDATE: we have all our boozy work lunches here. It's surprisingly popular. This time I went with the beet salad and added salmon. It was much better than the grilled salmon salad! Also had a glass of rose which was way too sweet for me but you can't really expect much in terms of wine at this establishment.",

            "I am writing this review in hopes that the flavor and quality control comes back to Brown Sugar Kitchen. I was a fan of the original restaurant in Oakland. I was so excited when it opened in the Ferry building. I went on Saturday for breakfast. I ordered the fried chicken, grits and eggs, and a biscuit. The grits had no flavor. They lacked salt and the flavor and creaminess that I remembered. My chicken was not cooked through and I had to take it back. The staff was very gracious and fired up another order within 15 minutes. I ate one piece while I was at the Ferry building and it too lacked flavor. I took the other piece home for later, only to find out that it too was not completely done. The biscuit was the only thing that had any flavor. I hope that this was just a sign of growing pains and the food will improve.  Until then I'll let my memories of the old Brown Sugar Kitchen suffice.",
            "Sadly must suggest you give this location a pass. Limited seating outside ( dirty tables and no heaters)  or a few facing the restroom. No coffee served means ordering from Blue Bottle two doors down ( $14 for three cups of coffee). Hassle. Although very tasty, $18 for a \"to go \" waffle with two small pieces of fried chicken is ridiculousThe same price with two boneless breasts might have been different. Beignets had potential but were underdone and served with a small portion of unremarkable raspberry jam. Ditto a cheese and bacon biscuit... also doughy inside. $4.50 each. Served with frozen butter of some kind(?)It was neither a reasonable value or a great meal... a shame given how good the Oakland location used to be.This is a typical example of a popular restaurant exploiting its reputation. Oh yeah... $60 for take - away breakfast for three and they wouldn't give us a cup of water."

            "I love meat. Although I do enjoy vegetables, I can never become vegetarian. Especially because ribeyes exist....SIGH. 5A5 Steak Lounge is a trendy steakhouse that is half dining room half bar. Lots of people were coming in dressed in suits and dresses. Beautiful scene. But no need to wear a suit to come here.I honestly came here for the Japanese A-5 Wagyu Experience. Throughout the food scene, the term \"WAGYU\" has been misused and un-apologetically placed on menus to describe meat that it not from Japan. Unlike 5A5, they actually show you the \"Certificate of Authenticity\" before showing you a platter of Japanese A-5 Grade Wagyu. It was definitely my first time trying REAL Japanese Wagyu and was definitely excited for this moment. We had a few appetizers to start.  Not too impressed with the Lobster Tempura and Truffle Fries. It wasn't the flavor...I guess it was just standard. Not memorable.1) Prime Rib: Delicious. It was perfectly cooked and had the right amount of marbling.2) Dry-Aged T-Bone: I wished the steak was served plain with just salt and pepper. It honestly didn't need the sous vide egg, bacon jam, and demi glace. Too much was going on.3) Double Ribeye: This was enormous! Need to split this with three people. Again, i do prefer steaks just plain as is to maintain the integrity of the meat.4) The A-5 Experience: So this platter, we all shared to have a taste of each steak. It consisted of 4oz Wagyu New York Strip, 4 oz Wagyu Filet, 4 oz Wagyu Ribeye, 4 oz Wagyu Ribcap. Wish I didn't have to share. the meat was SUPPPPPEEERRRRR TENDER. Like literally the nice cut through easily. Aside from the tenderness, the meat had such a unique flavor to it. It had richness from the marbling and earthiness from the intramuscular meat. The platter is designed to eat leaner cuts first then climax into the marbled cuts. So NY first, Filet second, Ribeye, fourth, and Ribcap last. I almost cried.Conclusion:Go here for the A-5 Experience. It's expensive but it will be one of the best steaks you'll ever have.",
            "This is a long time coming.5A5 is actually pretty amazing. From the time I entered that night, I knew I was gonna get my fill of delicious cuisine. It's been quite awhile since I had balled out for food so I was looking forward to this meal. I was however taken back a bit with my experience because I had many mixed emotions after. So much that \"it\" too, led me to delaying this review. However now that we have finally come to the bridge, I will lay down the low down. The as part of it all is that, this \"should\" of been a 5 star review however there are couple things that I just couldn't tolerate. To start things off, I came here on Vday. Valentines Day is the anniversary of me and my girlfriend's relationship starting so it is an extra special day. I always pride myself on thinking up a master plan to making the day a special day. Sadly, this wasn't one of my best years on planning. I picked an air BnB that didn't pan out the way I wanted and on top of that me and my loved one got terrible sleep the night before. So I was counting on the dinner to be icing on the cake. I had called 5A5 a day before to see if they did anything special for anniversary's. Nobody so I left a voicemail with my name and what time my reservation was at. They called me back the next day when I was at the exploratorium and asked for my name and what time reservation. I was a little puzzled because I already had provided them that information but I called them and left another voicemail since no one picked up. After I prayed and just hope that someone would surprise us at dinner time. Friggin rain. Ugh...Me and my girlfriend exited the Exploratorium only to be greeted by pouring rain. We walked to 5A5 Steakhouse since it was only 4-5 blocks away. We arrived at 9:45 and I advised host that we were there. 10 minutes pass and we aren't seated. Another 10 minutes pass and still no word. Not even just an acknowledgement or apology for being busy that night. My girlfriend wanted water so I went ahead and got some for the both of us. After I came back to hydrate, I noticed a couple was getting a little restless; specifically the dude. He looked mad irritated lol. Real talk. You ever have that moment in public where you see someone act a certain way, but it's like looking at yourself in the mirror? That's how I felt.This dude went up to the host and was like , \"We had a reservation at 9:45. How long is it going go be?\" The host looks up at him, smiles, and proceeds to calm him down. Super professional. That is until she made one comment...And like the savage she was, she said \"You aren't the only one who is waiting for a table sir.\" An continued to smile. The announcer from Power Stone uttered two letters. \"K.O.!!!!!!!!\" LOL. Was this real life? I never thought an employee at such a nice restaurant would give a customer the business like that. He looked SO broken. This was almost like when Sonic Fox beat PerfectLegend 11-0 at Mortal Kombat all those years ago(Heck it might of been 13-0...). That was the devil in me. 5 minutes later the host sat us down and before she left said, \"I sat you guys down before that couple because you guys were more patient.\"  Lmao. It really does pay to be a nice person sometimes and just turn the other cheek. But then the angel side of me set in. This wasn't right. I mean. When you've worked in customer service for at least 10 years like I have, events like this eat at ya a bit. Yes. Maybe the customer was a little unreasonable because if he looked around, he could easily tell that 5A5 had been busy probably for hours. It was a full house when we got there at 9:45 and it never changed at any moment when we were waiting. Luckily I'm extremely patient person but even still ate me. The customer is always right; EVEN when they are not. So it is for those reasons above that my review will come short a little which kinda makes me sad because I really enjoyed the food. The Lobster Bisque was probably the best I've ever had and the Filet Mignon was to die for. Cook a steak with perfection and use my favorite wine as a reduction...? Stahp it. Even our server was extremely professional and friendly. Honestly the food and our server saved my experience here. But yet no one even wished me and my girlfriend Happy Anniversary...So in Conclusion, beware. It sounds like there some employees here that have a stick up teh buttocks. Which is really unfortunate because the food here is actually bomb. However that degree of unprofessional is unacceptable and I doesn't the kind of language that was said. I definitely would come back but if I got the same treatment that couple did, I'd seriously ever come back again. Hopefully others that try this place out won't see the Darkside of 5A5 Steak Lounge.",
            "food was just Ok but probably not worth the price. dinner for 2 turned out to be $370 all in.   i had the $70 tbone medium rare.  came out very rare.  i wasn't able to eat  more than a few bites before i felt kind of nauseated (in hindsight i realized it was super undercooked). sides of fries, mac cheese, mushrooms were also ok but not different than standard bar fare.    i actually took the steak home and a few days later broiled it in my oven and it was edible but not above average."

            "My boyfriend and I visited Hillstone as our one \"splurge,\" dinner during a vacation in SF. I picked Hillstone because it was fancy but not quite as expensive as other nice restaurants in the area, and it did not have only a prix fixe menu, which is hard to find in SF. I am so glad we chose Hillstone. The location is perfect. It's just a few blocks away from the piers, so it's not right in a tourist spot, but is easy to get to if you've been sight-seeing beforehand. I appreciated the dim lighting because it created a romantic and calm atmosphere. Our waiter was very accommodating to our questions about drinks. I ordered a French 75 (my favorite cocktail and not on the cocktail menu) and it was one of the best I've ever had. It had finely shaved ice in it, which was a nice surprise.My boyfriend ordered the burger, and he really enjoyed it. He said it was just like a classic burger- nothing fancy, but that's what he likes.I had the French omelette. It was without a doubt one of the best omelettes I've ever had, but most of my omelettes come from brunch diners. I was worried it would be too cheesey, as I do not like a lot of cheese, but it was just right. The eggs were silky smooth, and the fresh herbs added a lot of flavor. I loved the vine tomatoes in the salad, too.We also ordered the famous artichoke. The menu said it was gone for the season, but the waiter told us they had some for \"this night only.\" I wonder if they always do that so that people will think they're lucky it's there and buy it? I enjoyed it, but did not understand the hype. To me, it tasted like regular grilled artichoke.One thing that bothered me was that even though the restaurant's website talks about not being kid-friendly, we saw several tables of kids. The website also talks about a dress code and that men must either have a collared shirt or will be given one. I saw plenty of men without collared shirts, even wearing t-shirts. Obviously this is all fine- what other people wear and if there are some kids doesn't really effect my experience. But I was confused why they would put these rules like no kids and a dress code on the website if they do not actually follow them.",
            "I took my friend here for his birthday and we went all out.Started off with a strong cocktail, so strong that I forgot the name of it.For appetizers we did the chips with artichoke dip, thai steak salad, and red beans and rice. Everything was very good here, my friend loved the chips and dip because it was perfectly gooey and seasoned. The thai steak salad was refreshing and not heavily dressed. The red beans and rice was my favorite!! I would honestly come back here JUST for this. Oh we also had the shrimp cocktail, shrimps were gigantic but I am not sure if it had that freshness I normally would enjoy at an authentic seafood place.I ordered the porkchop because I've never tried porkchop before in my life and I thought this upscale restaurant would do it justice. Unfortunately my pork came out really dry that I could not eat it... I gave it away to a homeless person the next day.. I also did not like that it came with the cooked red cabbage, and the mashed potatoes were standard. My friend had the prime rib which was SO much better than mine I actually took a large chunk since I couldn't eat my dish. His also came with the weird red cabbage and a baked potato. Neither of us liked the cabbage... they should consider presenting other options for sides.I gave this place an OK because of the atmosphere, appetizers, and drink. They also had live music on a Wednesday night I think it was, which was a pleasant surprise that made the dinner that much better!Again I think I would only come back here for cocktails and red beans and rice... haha.",
            "I made a reservation for my boyfriend and I to come here and dine for our late Valentines day dinner. We were late to our reservation but called on the way there and they were still accommodating about it despite it being a full house. We were advised that we would have to wait but got seated 10 minutes after checking in. Everything was just wonderful. What we got: Spinach & Artichoke dip The Hawaiian Bone-In Prime RibI loved everything! My favorite was the entree I got(The Hawaiian). It was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and the pineapple soy ginger sauce was so good! I would highly recommend this place. Plus, it's right near the pier. How much more romantic can that get?"

            "One of my favorite places to get work done, have good food and enjoy a drink on a weekday by FiDi. This place gets waves of customers during the say; it's a popular healthy (aussie-style) lunch spot, so from 1 to 2 pm on a weekday you can see lines of working professional forming to get some food and drinks. It can get a bit loud, too, so it's a great spot for focusing and doing work but nor great for taking conference calls or any work-related calls. They also have wifi and outlets, so you can camp out here for a few hours if you are in your zone. Pro tip: get a matcha latte with oat milk and the salmon toast. Delicious.",
            "Alright, I finally ended up on Yelp to do a review after my experience today.  I typically visit this location every Saturday after my appointments downtown.  Usually, they are good with service, attention to detail, etc.  Today, was just completely off.   I ordered avocado toast with 2 poached eggs, to eat in.  I bussed the table my friend and I sat at (if you go in, please bus your own table.  There's a spot to do so and it's not that hard).  We sat and talked and then my order comes out:  in a to go container, with my second poached egg in a cup of some sort.  Not entirely sure why the second egg wasn't on the actual toast, or why I got a to go container (specified we were eating there, coffee came in a glass).   So, already wasting non-reusable items when it could've been on a plate, plus it's easier to eat that way. Now, here's the part that made me write this.  I cut into the eggs and into the toast,  I have two hard boiled eggs.  Nope, not poached.  Instead of complaining I ate it, whatever- an egg is an egg.It's the overall experience.  Lack of attention to detail and not making sure the cafe is clean and picked up for other guests to enjoy.  I'll give it another try, as I know everyone has an off day.  If this is the new norm though, I'll take my business elsewhere.",
            "I was about to write a 1 Star review after the fiasco of this place last time when I was in Washington DC, where I didn't get a simple toast until 25 minutes later after I finished my coffee and the latte art got ruined by overpowering amounts of chocolate powder. I decided to give this place another try with the free coffee ticket they gave me for the inconvenience. I decided to check out their Aussie iced latte since after some research, this is an Australian inspired coffee shop. I got it with oat milk, and overall, I really liked it. Same goes for the salmon toast, where all the ingredients are fresh and they put it into a very nice takeout box, similar to when you pull something out of a drawer. It's pretty cute I guess.This time I am far from disappointed. I really enjoyed the food and drink as well as the customer service. I would go back again sometime, when I decide to splurge a little, because this is a very pricey place that would have set me back $19+ if it weren't for the promo and free coffee. Thanks for giving yourself a second chance; you earned back a customer :)"

            "Rainforest Cafe for adults!!One of the most unique experiences I've ever enjoyed in SF, and much better value than some others (e.g., Lazy Bear, which I also love but is very pricey). When you arrive at the venue, you walk through a rainforest-like room and are greeted by the hostess, who checks you in, hands you a welcome elixir (in our case, a kombucha made from Japanese flowers), and hang out until it's time to eat. Before dinner, we enjoyed drinks from the non-alcoholic bar, which offers a a broad variety of herbal drinks and snacks. We opted for a couple kava cocktails, both of which were delicious.Your ticket includes access to either LMNL, a series of rooms with varying AR/VR exhibits, or The Unreal Garden, an AR/VR exhibit with work by six different artists. Between the two, The Unreal Garden was by far more impressive, and very philosophical / deep in a way I wasn't expecting. Dinner was good though not mind blowing. There are five courses: - salad (carrots)- soup (salsify)- entree 1 (alaskan halibut, the first catch of the season - amazing!!!), - entree 2 (beef)- dessert (ginger asian pear sorbet)Each course has a vegan option. I don't eat beef, so opted for the vegan alternative for entree 2, which was a nightmare to work out with online customer service but was easily handled on the day of with the help of the conscientious waitstaff. Chef Nick Ronan is really passionate about his work, gave a speech midway through dinner to explain the concept of dinner, and came around and spoke to all the diners during the meal.Overall, couldn't recommend highly enough for a special occasion.",
            "Really amazing sensory experience! The team definitely put a lot of work into the design and ambiance as well as the food. I really liked the fish and the filet mignon, both were very tender and not dry. I would say my only real points for improvement are to have more light on the dish as sometimes it's a little hard to see what you're eating and the ginger-pear sorbet could have a stronger pear flavor.Great grand opening though, and if you didn't know if you buy the FEAST ticket, you get free access to LMNL and the Unreal Garden exhibits so it's definitely worth going to!",
            "First of all, what an amazing location. I've never experienced anything quite like F.E.A.S.T. From the moment we walked in and were escorted to our table by the super friendly staff, I knew this was going to be something special. The projected light show blew my mind! Such creativity. The five course meal was DELICIOUS along with the wine pairing. If I had to pick, the Filet Mignon was my favorite but everything else was just as yummy. It was neat to see Chef Nick Ronan interact with the guests. You could really feel his passion. This is truly a unique dining experience that you do not want to miss. I highly, highly recommend checking F.E.A.S.T. out!"

            "I hosted 14 people to a private dinner in the Cellar Room and it was phenomenal!   I had guests from diverse parts of the country...including North Dakota, Nevada, Ohio, Florida and Hawaii!    I also had 2 vegetarians in the group.The booking experience was exceptional.   Sarah T. was responsive and accommodated all of my requests without question.My diverse group of co-workers and clients loved the setting.  It was indeed the cellar, surrounded by shelves of wine in an industrial, rustic and yet classy all rolled into one.   It was cozy, intimate and a great setting for good conversations since there was no ambient noise you generally find in larger restaurants with open floor plans.Our waiter gave the group his personal attention and answered all questions and was accommodating to requests without hesitation.  I had him pick the small bites for the whole table but let each person pick their own entrees.   This worked out well.  Appetizers were brussel sprouts, shishito peppers, croquettes, cheese plates and crispy pork bellies.  This satisfied both vegetarians and meat eaters.  We all picked our own entrees.   I chose the wild boar, some had the trout, a chicken breast, a pasta and others.  The current theme was West Coast. Without exception, everyone loved the small plates and everyone raved about their entrees.   Both appetizers and entrees were of good portions, flavorful, bold and worked in harmony with a red cab that was recommended by our waiter.All in all, a great experience in the Cellar Room for a group or team dinner. I will definitely recommend this place and will do it again without hesitation next time I'm in town.   Maybe they will have Italy or Spain on their menu...Jim",
            "Penning this review somewhat pains me, as I know how wonderfully curated this establishment's wine list is. Truth on paper, in simple terms, nevertheless!Ordered two glasses of wine at the bar. Barman begrudgingly friendly. One of said glasses was what one may refer to as a \"not inexpensive, subtle, expressive Napa Cabernet\" with which I am very familiar. Had to request a Bordeaux stem rather than the thimble-like apparatus placed upon the bar. No problem, one thinks, wine will make up for that!Said wine obviously open for several days, and not up to snuff. Mentioned to barman. Advised that the wine was fine (one is rather foolish to presume that Oswald would be none the wiser on matters of drink), and refused to open another bottle. Told to order something else!Understood is the desire not to waste, but when a place such as this, claiming to specialize in all things vinous shows such an attitude, one isn't too pleased. Had planned to stay for some enlightening dinner fare, but the grubby attitude of the little man at the bar, along with the grill \"master\" releasing a deafening sneeze upon a steak put me right off the trail!",
            "Came here for SF Restaurant Week and was not impressed. Very understaffed and the food was disappointing for the price. We had Brussels sprouts that were soggy and chocolate cake that had bacon on it (there was no mention of it on the menu also a very strange combination)Definitely good for drinks/cocktails but would not recommend for anything more than that."

            "This place radiates nothing but good vibes. After galavanting through Chinatown, we stumbled upon RM 212. It looked really nicely decorated, so we decided to stop in. The place was trendy, the music was good, and the employees were extremely inviting. We were immediately greeted with warm smiles and decided to grab a seat at the bar. They have some awesome beers on tap, but I was super excited they had ciders, because they're hard to come by. The cider we tried was absolute perfection. Crisp, fresh, and not too sweet. I wish I had this on tap at my house.As for the food, we didn't get to eat here, but the guy next to us was raving about how good the hand rolls, shrimp, and sweet potato samosas were. We're definitely stopping by before our departure to make sure we get to try the food first-hand. The best part of this place are the people running it. The owners, Patrick (and I didn't get the other guys name) were so sweet. Great conversation and genuinely awesome dudes. They gave us some awesome recommendations on places to go and what places to stay clear of. And, they even hooked it up with a shot on the house. Thanks for everything!",
            "Foie gras wontons on the menu but they don't serve them anymore? The nachos are good. Korean fried chicken is \"very spicy\" (according to Anna). I found them durably spicy. Not super high in volume but it went for the distance. Sweet potato samosas were... Ok.Service was quick.Was a little put off by water that was in container at table. My mind wondered how long it had been there and if it was fresh. Just my two cents.Also... There was a couple to the left of us. The woman left abruptly while the check was being paid. The man followed shortly after. What happened? Did he say something? These are the days of our lives. Bye!",
            "The grumpy reviewer strikes again!Let's see. The sake was good, so there's that. The service, while not warm, was attentive, and everything arrived promptly. That's a big plus. Where to start on everything else. The ambience leaves a lot to be desired. Weird lighting choices combined with stupid TV screens. Gross. Toilet seat broken in the bathroom, which room doubles for some storage. A very dirty, and not needed, floor slick when wet warning sign in the dining area. No evidence of a functional heating system-we had to dine with our coats on! Electric cords strewn everywhere. All that wouldn't matter as much of the food was amazing, but we did not find it so. Points for trying to be creative - I love that, but being creative doesn't mean really tasty automatically. And the calorie to taste benefit was the poorest with the fried wontons filled with foie de gras--neither the addition of ginger nor the deep frying did anything to enhance the goose liver. In fact, the foie de gras was less tasty. The mango dipping sauce was definitely a miss. The tuna tacos promised a lot but didn't deliver, like so many politicians. The shrimp was fine, and the Brussels sprouts a highlight. I tried to order the sake flight but was told that was unavailable. Half the fun, gone. They have a good amount of fake cocktails, made with soju. Go wild if you want, but not for me. Give me real cocktails or go homIt was expensive in the end too, for the satisfaction of eating mostly just ok food in our coats, drinking not cheap sake. Meh. The owner or manager has responded below. A few points. I made observations and then made my preference. I don't like fake cocktails. I get the liquor license regulations which are unfair to proprietors. It wasn't raining, and even if it was, please clean the warning sign. No response on the broken toilet seat. Storage in the bathroom is probably unavoidable but detracts from the experience. No comment on the lack of heat on a very cold day. Maybe two 50s year old gay men aren't the right demographic because our internal thermostat burns cooler? I don't think my comments were unfair, they reflect my experience and I gave examples for each praise and complaint (there were both). Obviously people are going to like or not the food, and probably just portions of the menu. I don't believe in complaining about how food tastes at the time and sending it back to be wasted. It was certainly edible. And how did he know that I had the Nigori?"

            "Italian Homemade Company is AMAZING. - EVERYTHING TASTES SO GOOD!! We ordered three pasta dishes to share between the two of us because it was just that good. You can mix and match your pasta + sauces. We got the parpadelle, gnocchi, and tortellini with pasticciata sauce, marinara, and butter and sage. Loved the meatball sauce. The butter and sage is kind of an acquired taste so I would only recommend it if you like sage. I would say, though, that the pasta quality (the texture and chewiness) is the best part of the food. The sauces were ok. - The wait isn't bad even if the line seems long. We went at around 8 PM on a Friday night. The line was long but it moves very quickly because you order at the counter before finding a place to sit. No frills dining.- everyone is so nice! The place definitely had a very family feel. Would definitely go back again!",
            "My husband and I were craving pasta and tried this place out because of the high star ratings. We ordered two pasta dishes to go... fettuccine with white sauce and pappardelle with tomato sauce, and breadsticks on the side... nothing major. When I first walked in, I was expecting to be nicely greeted rather than standing for about 8 minutes just to let them know that I'm picking up my order. No friendly smiles. Just people speaking in their language which is quite rood. I finally paid and was eager to go try the food out. We found a spot nearby and got prepared to eat.As soon as we open the boxes we were shocked! The fettuccine with white sauce barley had any sauce to coat the pasta. My pappardelle was just okay and didn't have any major flavor to make my soul happy. It was just your basic tomato sauce with no taste of basil what so ever. I also asked for extra cheese on the side which I did not receive. The bread sticks were the worst ever! Like no joke. I'm not sure why it's even called bread sticks when it's more like pita chips that have been left out for a few days. Hard, dry, and tasteless. It was surely a waste of my $40 dollars and I will not be returningDo better Italian Homemade Company. Seriously. For everyone out there, don't always trust places with high ratings cause you might just get disappointed like we did!",
            "Uh, fresh made noodles with delicious sauces. This place is amazing. It's what I'd call a hole in the wall. First come, first serve.The meatballs are flavorful, the noodles supple, the lasagna perfectly balanced in texture. Drinks are bottled. When done you bus yourself.Given what it is, how delicious the food is, and how gorgeous the owners daughters are I simply cannot give this any less than 5. I've been to a few fancy Italian places. They drown the food in herbs or over salt. The blending here is superb. The prices are great. The selection fantastic."

            "So, so good! The wait was quick - about 20 - 30 min for 2 people. We went right at 3 pm. Anyway - ordered the crawfish beignets, chicken and sausage gumbo and fried chicken basket. The crawfish beignets are a must, they are fresh and cheesy inside with just the amount of seasoning and crawfish. The gumbo tasted just like we were in New Orleans but they were missing Tabasco sauce so we had to settle for the alternative which was just a Louisiana hot sauce. The chicken was alright - it didn't have much flavor and I am not really a fan of white meat. But it included a biscuit with some type of jelly which is to die for and the cole slaw was fresh and flavorful! Service was quick and attentive! Must check it out.",
            "First and foremost, expect to wait.The inside is small and quite... personal with other tables. We were called and then they sat another party that was after us at our table.The food was good, although I remembered it being better. I ordered the Crispy Pork Belly and it was good. I recall getting two thinner sliced pieces of pork on my last visit. The one slice I received this go-around was huge and difficult to eat. It wasn't sliced up, just a big block of pork belly. I also ordered grandma's molasses walnut coffee which I thought was different.The experience I had this trip was definitely more on the mediocre side. Would I come back if I were ever in SF again? Possibly, but I also would rather spend my time doing things I love instead standing in line for two hours smelling the wonderful aroma of urine and shit. To each their own though.If you're looking for a trendy, always busy restaurant--this is it! I love the mirror wall.",
            "Good, but I thought it was overrated, I was torn between 3 to 4 star.  I would never wait in line to eat here or most places for that matter like a lot of people seem to do.  I think that might just be the herd mentality/Jones effect when people wait an hour or so for a brunch place, I'd get too hangry for that! lolI really liked my Tofu hash and the portion was huge and shareable.  The beignets were ok but not something I would other again.  I prefer healthy options, but thought I'd try just because.The coffee was nothing to rave about which I think in a city like SF they should have good local coffee especially in boutique restaurants.  I tried my friends sweet ice tea and that was really tasty.  My friends seemed to enjoy their meals, and we shared the shrimp n grits.  I don't eat meat, but they ordered fried chicken.Cute little casual brunch spot with cozy New Orleans theme.  They sell jam and some other items which my friends bought to take back home."

Looked at the menu. Its a wine and beer bar with bites.  Sat at the counter/ bar. Ordered a glass of Rose, reasonably priced at $13 and was a hefty pour. Next glass,  the last of the malbec. It's sold out..as of this second lolNow for the bites. The garlic bread with added slice tomato on the side and the brussel sprouts were our choices. The brussel sprouts alone make this place 5 stars.  Please try these sprouts. I beg of you",
            "Food: Brussels sprouts were amazing, the mushroom toast was delicious. Mac and cheese wasn't as flavorful.Nice ambiance and friendly service",
            "So here I am freshly landed in San Francisco, in a city I have yet to discover, completely jet lagged from the east coast/west coast flight. And I'm hungry. I did not feel like eating in a crappy fast food in a place with bright fluorescent lights. Nor did I want, as I was by myself, to eat in a restaurant that was too formal.Yelp to the rescue! A quick search on what was close to the hotel, and I found this little gem. Just what I needed!First, the vibe. I loved (LOVED!) the dark-ish ligthing, mostly coming from the red neon sigh. Beautiful place, designed yet casual, warm, inviting. Being alone, I sat at the bar.I ordered the gruyere grilled cheese with bone marrow onions, and the sauteed brussels sprouts with jalapeños. Absolutely decadent, delicious, comforting. Yep, just what I needed. Oh, is that craft beer you have on tap? Oh yes, I'd like one please! Faction Brewing from Alameda, kudos for this WES KAAP IPA, an excellent IPA hopped with african hops.Sated, fully satisfied of this evening, I walked back to the hotel, ready for a good night sleep, excited for the day to come."

            "Fog City has been pretty hot or miss for me over the years but I'm always willing to try things a few times and while having a quick business lunch the other day I was impressed with my order. I mean, it was damn delicious! I won't go into why this place is hit or miss because I don't want to bash the business but, lets just say in a past experience I wasn't able to eat for a few days due to some undercooked food. Damn shame I tell you. Anyway, it seems they've found their footing again and my salmon sandwich was really good. The service was also really lovely and attentive. I'm always a fan of fast service during lunchtime hours because we've all got stuff to do right?! I'll be back for that sandwich again because it really is a masterpiece.",
            "What else can be said about the Fog City Diner? That it might be the best Americana restaurant in San Fransisco. Everything I've ever had there, from the amazing flattened half chicken, to the oyster based appetizers to the strong drinks, has been too notch.The decor is well done. The staff is always impeccable. It's somewhat pricey but I think they'd get away with being more pricey. Suitable for celebrations, or just hanging out. If you want Americana fusion, you can't go wrong.",
            "We last came here years ago when it was known as Fog City Diner.  After a brief time closed, it emerged as Fog City. No matter the name, it's still one of the dining gems of the city. The food may not be adventurous or revolutionary, but sometimes being simple is just fine. All of their offerings are good tasting and a fair portion for the price. Enrique took good care of us as did the rest of the staff. We especially liked the Truffle Fries, Onion Rings, Brussels Sprouts, Burger, and Fried Chicken!  Get the Beignets if you have room in your stomach!"

            "I came here for Saint Patrick's Day weekend after walking around the downtown area with friends and watching the parade at the block party down the street. First time here and could say that the bar was nice in atmosphere, decor was lit and theme was on point. I may have had one or two many drinks. Also leading to accidentally leaving my wallet somewhere in the lounge. Luckily I contacted the day after and the bartender told me that they found it and I could pick it up at the bar. The honest reply of the staff and the experience at the club made it a fun night",
            "One of my favorite places to come when out on the town. Absolutely love the decoration and style of this place. So loungy which a great bar. Music/DJ could be a bit better though. Definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in the area. -B",
            "After my terrible experience the last time I was here, the manager offered to send me a gift card to give this place another chance. Never received the gift card but decided to bring my team here for a happy hour anyway. Made a reservation for a party of 15. Arrived and the host said she couldn't find my reservation. She also kept asking if the reservation was under \"Barbara\" as there was clearly a table saved for a large party under Barbara by the front door. She disappeared for 10 minutes while my group is just standing there at the door waiting to be seated. When she eventually comes back, she confirms that she does not have my reservation and after I showed her the confirmation email, she disappears again to speak to the manager! Finally, she comes back and says that she has a table for us, she walks us to a table that fits 5-6 people. Did she just expect the rest of us to stand????!! She mentioned that she would be bringing stools but judging by the looks of it, we still would not fit with stools around the table. More time passes and she doesn't bring stools or menus so we decided to leave and give our business to another bar. Very disappointing considering the entire place was practically empty with the exception of a few folks. I used to be a regular here but after my two recent experiences, I will not be returning."

            "Rain or shine, this hole in the wall has such a long line line but is it worth it? Yes! I've only been here twice but every single time it's better than the last. The mexi-bowls are so good and ordering it is so easy.Lunch time is from 10:30 to 2:00!First, you wait in the long line. Even if you try to get there early, there's already a line out the door. Second, when you get to the window you have to choose your vessel and that includes Mexican rice, quinoa, vegetables or greens. Next, you choose the meat - carnitas, chicken or roasted vegetables. Last, you choose the sauce. I always go for the chimchurri sauce. I'm not a spice or hot fan so I'd recommend this one. As soon as you're done paying, most of the time your order is ready to go. Just like that, you're on your way back to the office to eat this delicious bowl packed with goodness.",
            "Ordered the half rice and half veggies bowl with pork. I also included the black beans and sauce into the mix. The rice and veggies were pretty good and the pork was well seasoned. The beans were actually too salty which made the bowl itself quite salty. Other than that, isolating the beans, the bowl was good.",
            "This review refers to Chica's Levi's Plaza window that's open only during lunch hours. The sole offering here is their Mexi-bowls - think Chipotle but better and fresher. You choose from rice, greens, quinoa, or veggies as your base, and then you can add pork (carnitas), chicken (pollo al horno), or more veggies on top.Prices might look a tad spendy on the surface, but they're on par with everything in this area at lunchtime, and your servings will be bigger than that of Chipotle (admittedly not the most flattering comparison but still the one that first comes to mind). Pro tip: try ordering online before you head here as they're minimally staffed and the in-person waits can be quite long."

            "Met a friend here on a Sunday morning around 10:30am. It's such a tiny place, but waited a bit and were able to get a table outside. I got the Daily Toast (~$8), and it was beautifully presented with lots and lots of fruit. I loved the mascarpone spread, definitely decadent. It was a pretty big size which I liked, but definitely on the sweeter side from the fruit. My friend got the Egg on a Croissant (~$8) because she was told it was one of the most popular items. She said that even though it doesn't look filling it actually is. She also said the croissant was nice and flaky and the sauce went well on it! I got a Tumeric latte (~$5), which I felt was way too foamy and watered down. My friend got the Matcha Chai latte (~5), which I tried and liked it way better than mine! Overall, super cute spot and I'd come back here again.",
            "If you are wanting to avoid the crowd and grab a seat in this tiny establishment, come early! I had no issues with a large crowd but by 9AM, it can be quite jammed. The menu isn't too extensive, and the items are very simple. I ordered the egg on croissant and was happy with the overall meal. I do love their vision and goal of this tiny cafe, but I feel it is a tad bit overpriced or they need to offer real dishware versus paper. At $8, it was steep for the small size, especially knowing the croissant most likely was outsourced. If you don't dive that deep into it and care for quality only and not price, don't fear!The gentleman who took and made our order was extremely nice and enhanced the overall experience! He was knowledgeable of the menu and coffees and could answer any question we had. I'd return for the great service.All in all, if you want a quick, casual breakfast, this is a wonderful option. It is surrounded by hotels though, so be aware it could be filled with lots of tourists in case that's not your thing."

            "I don't know where to start. I have never been in a situation that started out rough and was so quickly turned around. My family did an Uber eats type of delivery through the yelp app. The food arrived a little late and was cold. A couple of pieces of toast were charred. Since we rely on yelp when checking places out, we went straight to reviewing the establishment. That's when things got awesome.Sam, the owner and manager responded to a review, 1st with ab apology then asking how he could make the situation better. We told him we have a few more days in town and we would stop by and see him. He gave us his cell and asked when we were coming to make sure we were treated with care. The morning we went to eat there, I text Sam on his cell to let him know I was coming. I was so happy with how he handled the situation that I brought more family with me! We showed up and he made sure we were seated and our waitress was very attentive to our needs. After the meal we discussed again the debacle the first time and we were glad we came back to give it and him another shot!  The food was plentiful and well priced for San Francisco. I ate a breakfast burrito that made me want to lean over and punch my neighbor. It was huge but I ate the whole thing and scooped up every scrap on the plate! So here's the deal. We did get a slice of toast that was burnt the first time around and Sam immediately apologized and made sure to reinforce to the staff that there was no excuse for that type of service, he then reached out to us to see if he can make it right. And he did. He treated my e tire family of 9 very well and even gave a treat to my little one. I am now back home from my vacation and I get a text. Who is it from? SAM! He text to say he hopes we made it home well and that it was a pleasure to meet my family (I mean, we ARE pretty fun!)We write scathing reviews when we feel mistreated as customers, but we try to keep a balance and give a good review when we are treated well. As you can see in the reviews here, if something goes wrong, Sam is quick to respond and help make things right. Thanks Sam!!!And I almost forgot. I mentioned Uber eats through here. It really sucks because those delivery services stack orders so as the person comes in to grab my food because it is ready, they wait around another 15-30 minutes to pick up another order and make it in one trip. This should not be allowed. The restaurant owners have no say and no recourse when this happens. So when it does make sure to complain to the service about your cold food, maybe we can change it so they don't stack orders. Cold eggs... not so good!"

            "This restaurant in Pescadero is known for its pies and artichoke goodness, and I completely get it. We came on a gloomy, cloud-covered day, and the creamy artichoke soup seriously hit the spot. In fact, I still dream about it.Our original plan was to get the artichoke bread from Arcangeli bakery and get the soup to go from Duarte's but they don't do to go orders - that's how popular it is. So, we decided to stay and I'm so glad we did, because their other specialty is the Ollaliberry pie. Definitely get it a la mode. The berries are a little sour but the ice cream is just sweet enough to balance it all out.The menu has the restaurant's history written on it, describing how it's been family owned and operated for four generations and how it became famous for the pies and artichoke dishes.Service was really quick and efficient despite being pretty busy. Our waitress was super friendly and explained to us what ollaliberries actually are - a cross between loganberries and youngberries (which are hybrids of their own). Anyway, Duarte's should definitely be on your list if you're making a stop in Pescadero.",
            "Food: 2/5     Price: 3/5      Service: 2/5        Ambience: 3/5A 4 generation tavern since 1894 in Pescadero, 45 miles south of San Francisco. Today, Duarte's vegetable garden is just behind the restaurant. The three full-time gardeners grow Ron Duarte's pick of artichokes, onions and leeks, many kinds of beans and peas, lettuce and squash, chard, fennel, herbs, olallieberries and strawberries. The restaurant's artichoke soup is so popular that the garden simply feeds their own family with artichokes; hundreds arrive at least twice a week from two other local family growers.The bar was the highlight. Sitting at a 100-year-old seat in a dim small room was an experience. Service was very slow and bad, no one refilled our drinks, and we were continually rushed to leave so others can sit down.Cream of artichoke & green chili ($11.50) - 2/5. their classic, overhyped. The soup was rich and thick, to be paired with their house sourdough(tough). Was a mediocre soup in my opinion.Deep fried smelt appetizer ($9.50) - 3/5. decently sized appetizer, nice crisp to the smelt, pairs well with tartar sauce and salsa."

            "Legit small general store with that charming country feel.  For a country store, it is pretty clean and somewhat upscale.  If you are comfortable at Whole Foods, you will most definitely be comfortable here.  And the opposite will yield the same, if you dislike Whole Foods, you will not get this place.Camping down the way, we started to get low on some supplies.  We were able to get everything we needed plus nice materials to make sandwiches for our later hike.  Everything will be a tad more expensive, but this isn't your suburban grocery store.  And most things are upped a notch as the pre-sliced deli meat are above Oscar Meyer level.The main star we found out whilst here is their Artichoke Bread.  It seems to be baked either here or super close, so it is pretty darn fresh.  I didn't get anything warm, but the freshness was still more than apparent.  They also do many different variations, some with garlic, some with basil pesto while others are half baked, meant to be put in another oven for ultimate appeal.We chose a Pesto Artichoke Bread, to go with some Peppered Turkey and some creamy Muenster cheese.  Legit.  The bread we chose was flat-ish, much like focaccia.  But it had a tad more structure than basic focaccia dough.  The artichoke wasn't super present, as you might get one bite per small sandwich.  But the baked-on pesto and cheese surface definitely takes the experience up a few levels.  My first time having this bread, and I'm sold and will utilize it again.It's in a very small town, maybe a half street worth of businesses.  I came during a slower time of year (winter) and it was already showing signs of bustle.  I can't imagine how the population will mob here when the weather is super nice or a long weekend.  The spacing will just not add up.  I don't think I want to find out.  But still coming back, just not with the mob.",
            "If you're anywhere near Pescadero, this is a must stop. Get to Arcangeli's as soon as you can and grab a loaf (or two!) of the artichoke bread. Hurry, because it goes fast! It's so soft and has large chunks of real artichokes baked in. I could probably eat the entire loaf in one sitting, if we're being completely honest. I promise you, it won't disappoint.The bakery is located right on the main street in town. It tends to be crowded and lines are long, since everyone comes for the artichoke bread. They have plenty of other options too though, if artichokes aren't your thing. Garlic cheese bread, focaccia, the list goes on.I suggest coming early for the bread, picking up some fresh goat cheese at Harley Farms, and going for an oceanside picnic.",
            "This town is two miles off if Hwy 1. It is a place that should be visited if you are on Hwy 1. This store has some amazing sandwiches. We had The Godfather. It has some superb flavors. We also bought some if the Garlic Cheese n Artichoke bread to try later. I will post the verdict later. This Place Rocks"

            "First things first. Parking is valet only and at a premium. For guests staying overnight, parking is a whopping $49 a day. During weekdays, parking is $25 and i don't believe there is a discount for dining in...at least I didn't get one.Anyway, my review and rating is on the food, ambiance and service....and all three are impeccable. Gerald, the manager at the Conservatory area is a consummate professional and made me feel like the most important person in the room. This kind of service is a dying trait, especially in the Bay Area where service has become horrible in general.Navio features a menu of raw selections -- oysters, sashimi and fat, poached gulf shrimp, to name a few -- but the aforementioned spaghetti chitarra proved too tempting to pass up, as did the special one night of Maryland soft shell crab. There are non-seafood options including duck (awesome), a 14-ounce ribeye and a 10-ounce filet mignon with an incredible texture. Ordered medium rare, the filet was perfectly pink and served atop two crisp potato cakes.A must try for a special occasion!",

We were also seated in a hallway where they had all the tables squished next to each other to add even more mismatched tables and chairs  they must have found in the back, cause you know, what they really need is more people in line. Aside from the view, there's nothing noteworthy.  This did not feel like \"the Ritz\" at all. Ps. We went for Sunday brunch this past weekend. The caviar is bottom of the barrel. Good luck!",
            "Do you have money to blow? Do you like caviar?If yes to the above questions, then this brunch is for you -- the Ritz way (but alcohol not included, *shocked* considering it's ~$150/person). The star of this buffet brunch is their (unlimited) caviar featuring 5 kinds! Other foods also include oysters, seafood, sushi, prime rib, dimsum, breakfast foods, charcuterie/etc. However, I would say the selection is quite limited (i.e. they only have 1 soup selection) and the food didn't totally blow me away. But cute and extensive dessert station!Beautiful views. Exceptional Service. Thank you to my kind boyfriend's parents for this treat :')"

            "Eating at Barbara's Fishtrap is a tradition for my family whenever we're visiting the area. Over the years, we've figured a few things out about the place, like what to order, what to wear, what to bring, etc. What I will start off this review by telling you is that the Fishtrap serves some delicious food and it gets absolutely jam-packed during peak hours, so there may be a little bit of a wait. It will be worth it, if you prepare for it.Eat your staple comfort food seafood dishes here like clam chowder in a bread bowl, fish and chips, clam strips, fried calamari, and the like. These are the things that the Fishtrap does the best. The further you venture away from these items, the further you risk being jealous of everyone else in the restaurant who is eating delicious fried food.Dress WARMLY. As you will most likely experience a little bit of waiting, you should prepare to spend some wait time in the foyer (which is basically outside). Not only that, but you might actually be seated in the outside covered patio area. There are heat lamps, but you should still dress warmly because the cold and sea breeze from the outside can absolutely permeate the space.Bring cash, because the Fishtrap does not accept cards. There is an ATM inside but bringing cash ahead of time will make your life a lot easier. Also, to reiterate, please bring a coat. Please. You will feel better. Your wife will feel better. It's just a good idea.Every visit my family and I have had has concluded with us leaving full and happy, and as the years have gone on and we've lived and learned, less cold as we come better prepared each time. Enjoy! This little place gets crowded for a reason!",
            "Only came here to get clam chowder to go and oh boy was I glad ! The clam chowder was creamy and filled with tons of clams in every bite. The broth used was so flavorful. Didn't get a Chance to dine in.",
            "Found this on Yelp, Half Moon Bay, CA about 30 miles south of San Francisco.CASH ONLY  Expect a Wait, they close early at 8 pm...check hoursWas in the mood for fried calamari/and fish and chips. This spot came recommended by locals and also Yelp.  Dropped my phone in the local hotel toilet...yes, I know GROSS...so no pics with this one, phone was turned off and drying in the car after drying and sanitizing with 91% rubbing alcohol (which worked by the way).The calamari did not disappoint, although it did not look nearly as good as some of the photos, the pieces were much smaller and darker but the taste was there.  The fish and chips were OK, I much preferred the calamari, the chips were good. Coleslaw was average at best and sloppily piled on the plate next to the fried calamari with the chance for the calamari to get soggy...not impressed, if ordering again, I would get chips with the fried calamari. Loved the red dipping cocktail sauce for the calamari.We also ordered Clam Chowder which was average...and a basket of bread which we enjoyed.Service was slow and somewhat scattered/rough around the edges, no frills.We dined inside...lovely views of the ocean but small very casual dining room."

            "Understand that this place has been through 3 owners over the last 5 years. That said, we had a fantastic experience this afternoon there with our kids.  We ordered some of the BBQ, the pickle appetizer and kid plates for the littles (there was BBQ on the kids menu-- nice touch). The service was prompt and warm.  We had a chance to chat with Michael, the new manager about the history of the place and his future plans.  Hubs is picky about BBQ sauce-- he likes it tangy and not too sweet and their's hit all the right notes. The meat was smokey and very delicious. We the brisket and the pulled pork. So delicious.Notable-- the pickle appetizer plate. Clocking in at $11, my expectations were high. It arrived on a foot long wooden board, and it did not disappoint.  Fennel, squash, garlic, beets, green beans, purple potato salad (not pickled, but a nice little serving), piquillo peppers, dill pickles, celery, and carrots. Each one had its own seasoning and was very distinctive.  The plate could have been an entree in itself.  The sides of salad and coleslaw were also quite good and appeared home made.The beer garden-- this component is absolutely necessary for dining with out little group of feral progeny.  We were treated to a cozy heater and the little guy had fun exploring. The last time we were here it was just a dirt lot (and there food was terrible).  I'm really hoping to return soon and enjoy the epic views and pickle plate.",
            "Ok, with total transparency I never actually ate here. But, that is in fact why I am writing a bad review.We came into town for a quick getaway from the city. After working all day- we head into this quaint area for one night of some rest and relaxation. After checking in we head over to Highway 1 Brewing Company to get some dinner. We arrived at 7:40 and they closed at 8pm. They turned us way. When I looked inside they had everything cleaned up and all chairs put up on tables.I worked over 10 years in the restaurant industry. I know that it sucks when you don't see any customers for a long time only to have one come in at the end of your shift, just before closing. But, you are open so you take them and treat them nice and get them some food. In fact, you can clean up most everything leaving just enough open or out so you can help a customer, should they come in. I mean, you take customers during normal business hours... it is basic customer service.",
            "I've been meaning to stop by this place after passing it several times. It was also recommended by a friend who lives nearby, so I finally made a trip out there for lunch.Located about 10 miles South of Pescadero Beach, Hwy 1 Brewing Company sits just off the east side of Hwy 1, almost directly across from Gazos Creek Beach. There's a gas station that shares the parking lot, which is convenient if you need gas too.I rode out there on my motorcycle and easily found a spot to park in their parking lot. They have a good sized tap room as well as a decent sized dining area that has large windows facing the road and coast. They also have a large, dog friendly back patio with picnic benches. I picked a seat in the dining room near the windows, looked over the menu on the table and walked to the counter to order a BBQ chicken sandwich with cole slaw and an Arnold Palmer. My order was taken by the friendly cashier, I paid and she said she would deliver my order as soon as it's ready. My lunch was $18, which is a bit steep for a sandwich, slaw and soft drink, but it was good, so I won't ding them for it.I returned to my seat and before I knew it, my food was delivered with a smile, as well as my beverage, a napkin, knife and fork. It looked and smelled delicious, and it was! The chicken was tender and tasty, and served with housemade bbq sauce on an extremely fresh potato roll. I slathered it in bbq sauce and chowed down. The slaw was also very fresh, crispy and tasty. I liked the addition of corn in their slaw. It adds a bit of sweetness to it. I also liked how it wasn't a mayo heavy. Too much mayo in slaw es no bueno! I also like how they serve their beverages with eco-friendly paper straws. Very nice.Will I be back? Absolutely. I really want to try their house beers and other food options. It'd be fun to go there with some friends and have some pints on the back patio.Pros:Location is epic, plenty of parking, plenty of seating indoors and out, friendly service, good food with decent variety, and pretty fair prices. Did I mention that they have a dog friendly patio? ;)Cons:There were quite a few flies in the dining room. They may want to rectify that asap ;) *Some reviewers mentioned that there's no cell reception out there. They have free wi-fi, or here's an idea....disconnect for an hour. I swear, you'll live!"

Just fantastic.I also had a passion fruit drink, very good - just a little bit pricey for the size of the cup.Nice views, great atmosphere.",
            "I remember this place used to be better. We ordered take out.Lobster roll was ok. Calamari was calamari which is good. The truffle gnocchi was probably the best thing there which is still like a 3/5.The clam chowder was so underwhelming and bad. Usually when a stew or chowder is really good, you want to get extra bread and dip more into it to eat more of the sauce. There was barely any clams in it.Price wise, definitely overpaid for what we got. Location is nice though",
            "If there was an underground parking garage (and I realize this is IMPOSSIBLE lol) it would be a five!  I'm not sure how we were finally lucky enough to find a parking spot here...  Likely it was because it was a Tuesday around 3?  haha But even so, the only spot available was one we weren't sure was legal a ways down the street.  ;) Once we arrived at the door though?  Everything was one notch better than expected.  For a tourist destination restaurant, you can't go in with expectations blazing for excellent service, perfect food, and a table with a view available within an hour.  Sam's figured it out on the Tuesday we were there though!  It was fantastic!  There was a bit of a wait for a table, but there was space at the bar!  We headed on over there and my 1 week OVERDUE pregnant belly did alright sitting up on the barstools that had backs (thank the lord! ) The bartender did a great job making sure everyone was satisfied with a libation of choice while they talked about the gorgeous day outside.  Our table was ready in the time they told us and we ended up getting a great window table overlooking the Pacific - HEAVEN.  The fish was WAYYYYY better than I had hoped, Clam Chowder was divine... Our server was on top of things and the atmosphere was very chill, which I appreciated in my state.  ;)  My only complaint was that there were a TON of flys hovering about... I had to constantly keep an eye on our food and wave my arms over the table.  It was quite a bummer, but the overall experience was great and the grounds were amazingly romantic to enjoy a nice after meal walk.  We will certainly not be shy anymore to try and get in there if we spy a parking spot during a drive by in the future!  Ooh LALA***the review above has been sitting in my drafts for 4 years!  And Omg, the memories we have created here since then!  I'll be writing an update soon as a part of my hiatus Hail Mary return!"

Africano and double espresso are my favorite. No sugar needed, the shots are smooth. I once left my drivers license there and they saved it for me until my next visit. I was told by the barista that she thought of sending it but knows people move often. Thankfully they didn't mail it as I had just moved and they saved me a trip to the DMV.I love this place, it is the highlight of my distance bike rides. I don't need to be loved, just give me my coffee...please. My attitude is changed to gratitude after a perfect Africano, and the world seems a kinder and gentler place."

            "Comfort Food meets craft beer lovers heaven. This place is a must stop if driving up/down the Pacific Coast Highway in Half Moon Bay. This is my second visit to The Barn and it again exceeded my expectations. To start, I asked for WiFi. Password was 'bestburgerever!'. Now how is that for setting up your expectations? I had to order the burger so I made it the Hot Farmers Burger with Sirracha Aioli and Jalepeno's added. Nieman Ranch Beef was used and it was served as ordered, a perfect medium rare. BEST BURGER EVER. Nice bun, good crunch, perfect amount of melted cheese which really satisfied. On the side a half salad and sure, why not, Storms Side Mac & Fry. No stop here is complete without trying the deep fried mac and cheese in a perfect crunchy square. When you look up comfort food in the dictionary there should be a picture of these nuggets of joy. DO IT. Now, the beer. There are about 5 selections of the best local craft beer you'd ever need. The staff let me taste a bit of all so I could make the most informed decision. Today it was the Bare Bottle Juicy Couture Dust Style IPA. One of the best Bare Bottle beers I've had to date. Alright, might as well have 2. Great staff. Great atmosphere. Fun open kitchen where you can learn some new tricks. Great food and drink. Do it.",
            "I just checked in (9th Yelp check in) and apparently I'm the duke of this place so I figured it's time to write a review. You're probably wondering why I'm giving this place 3 stars if I've been back 9 times. Great question. This place is basically a monopoly with no competition. There aren't many independent restaurants in the area with outdoor seating, so this becomes the go to. The main reason I keep coming back here is because of the outdoor seating that's perfect for lunch on a rare sunny day in HMB. The cons here:1. Expensive for what you're getting. I get a burger and fries and it usually costs me $20 for a burger they can't lettuce wrap. Burger is not mind blowing by any means. 2. Line is SO long. One cashier who takes forever to take your order and is not helpful when you ask questions about the food3. Food takes forever to get to you. I'm talking 45 minutes after waiting 30 minutes to order. 4. 20% tip default on their POS system when you check out, but there is no service other than them dropping off your food. No water, no dish service. 5. As I'm writing this review, the \"waiter\" drops off the food and as I ask him for a fork, he points me to the cashier to get them. Thanks bro. If a competitor ever opens up here this place is in trouble.",

After looking at others reviews I decided to order their Barn Burger with American Cheese and their Mac Attack. I placed my order to go and the wait wasn't that long. However, once I got home I was left disappointed. The burger lacked flavor, overall it tasted really bland. Their Mac Attack also lacked flavor. I gave one piece to my sister who loves Mac n cheese but she said she didn't like this one either. Food was ok, not sure I'll be back."

            "Just to be clear, this is a campground BBQ place. My husband and I were looking for somewhere to eat as we passed through the area, and there are very few options (I'm honestly surprised it shows up on the map). The food here is typical of a place that serves a captive audience: extremely overpriced, passably edible and underwhelming ($20 for a hotdog and corn on the cob, for example). Avoid this spot unless you are desperate or staying at the Costanoa campgrounds and do not have any other food."

            "Everyone talks about this place so I figured I'd come in for dinner one evening while in Half Moon Bay. The day we came in they were hosting a large private event, so service was understandably slower than perhaps it might have been. We ordered the ahi poke, calamari, popcorn shrimp -- all pretty tasty, nothing mind-blowing. The shrimp was definitely my favorite. For my main I had the mahi tacos and they were delicious. Definitely recommend. I tried my friend's coconut shrimp taco and that was delish as well. The semi-exposed kitchen is a cool concept, but for a seafood restaurant with heavily fried items, perhaps not the best idea? The scent of cheese, crab, and oil permeates throughout the dining room and it took days to get the smell out of my jacket. Not sure I'll be back, but glad I tried it!",
            "Insect I got the calamari, a prawn salad, lobster roll, and complimentary Brussels chips. I didn't think the prawn salad was particularly tasty but it wasn't bad. The lobster roll had big pieces of lobster and a cole slaw that was just okay. The Brussels chips were probably fried and not baked so they were very oily. Here's the part that made me experience not so great. I really liked the squid ink aioli dipping on the calamari. I didn't finish it so I took the rest to go. When I opened my box of calamari later that night (about 6 hours after I had dined there), I found a WORM in the box! I don't think it could have gotten in another way besides being in the calamari. Not sure if the worm came out because the seafood was fresh (fresh seafood tends to have more worms) or because I didn't refrigerate it right away. Either way, it was very off putting considering the other things I ordered weren't particularly memorable.",
            "This is one of our favorite go to places to eat. We love the crabby cheesy bread and clam chowder when we come here. We make sure to bring out of towners here too to enjoy the food!The only thing this time around though is the crab pesto pasta was different than the last time around. It didn't have as much pesto and they added an overwhelming amount of bell peppers. Last time the pesto sauce was perfect and there were no peppers. I would stick to the basics here, but we will still be back!"

            "The wait was about 40 mins on a weekday at 10am. We ordered locomoco (Kalua pork) and the matcha pancakes. Locomoco was decent, but nothing special. Pancakes were good and not too sweet.Anyways, the worst and the reason for the 1 star review is that they changed my tip. I wrote down an amount on the receipt and when I checked my bank account, they gave themselves more tip... who does that?!! Such dishonesty.",
            "Seems to have a perpetual waiting list even during weekdays, this in most cases indicate that food and service are GREAT.  I will unfortunately need to differ in my personal opinion.  The service was really good, the wait is what it is.  but where we fall short is the food and price.  Our order was locomoco (beef), cornedbeef, garlic fried rice, and matcha pancakes.The portions are definitely huge along with the huge prices.  The locomoco was average, nothing special.  I was expecting the gravy to wow me but was just eh.  The cornedbeef garlic fried rice topped of with ketchup and tonkatsu sauce with furikake over a giant omelet, again was average.  Matcha pancakes, definitely had matcha but would be better if a sauce accompanied with it...perhaps a banana mac type syrup.Our bill 3 items with coffee and tea around $78 bucks...pretty expensive and just not worth the 45min to 1hour wait."

            "Yes, this place is touristy and overpriced. But they have a great fish sandwich, so I put up and shut up. Plus, eating and sitting on a patio surrounded by dogs is pretty close to heaven on earth. Out of the other items I've tried, the fish sandwich is the one I reorder. The waiter asked if we wanted coleslaw or fries. I chose the coleslaw and my friend had the fries. Their coleslaw is spot on. I had some of my friend's fries, and they were perfectly crispy. However, when the server was asking the table next to us which sides they wanted, he said they could go half/half fries and slaw as well. Well, I would've liked that option as well. But good to know for the future. I'd try my best to avoid coming here on the weekend. Parking can be hard and the wait can be long. The last time I came was on a weekday. There were only a few tables, but that meant good service and food coming quickly out of the kitchen.",
            "I have been here many times over the years. I'll​ start by saying that I love their beer. That's​ why it pains me to give them less than 5 stars, but I just can't in good conscience​ go higher than three​. In fact, if I didn't​ like the beer as much as I do, I would be forced to go lower. I have had many amazing meals here over the years. However, today was miserable. I ordered a $19 crabcake benedict. What arrived on my plate was a poorly fried egg and an oily sad excuse for a crab cake on ... wait for it ... a brioche​ bun. I'm​ not sure what alternate universe they are from but that is a glorified fried egg sandwich​, not a $19 benedict that deserves a place on a brunch menu​. And don't get me started on the cheap imitation of​ hollandaise​ sauce they drizzled on top​. This dish left me with a feeling of walking into a theater expecting​ a Hollywood​ blockbuster and getting a poorly voiced over kung-fu movie from the 80s. The only explanation​ I have is that they must have changed management or ownership who has decided to cut costs (and corners). I may never be able to come back. :(I will say, the view from the patio is great and they allow dogs so its a great place for a drink in the sun. Stick to the beer and don't​ order any food. If you must​, go for the nachos. It's hard to mess those up.",
            "Took my dog, Moose, out to play on Mavericks beach for his 11th birthday. On our way home, we saw that Half Moon Bay Brewing Company has a dog friendly patio so we dropped in for a late lunch.We ordered:- Crispy Calamari: hot and crispy without feeling too heavy. This appetizer comes in a pretty big basket so definitely share this!- Ceviche: Chips that came with it were alright but I really enjoyed how refreshing the fish ceviche was.- Saison x2: Reaaaally smooth beer but nothing too special.- Lavender Lemon drop: This one was pretty interesting. It tastes like lemonade infused with lavender and a touch of alcohol. The drink color is really pretty as well! Highly recommend trying this one out.- Cran-Razz Belgian Blonde: If you're a fan of Framboise Lambic like I am, you will DEFINITELY like this one. It tastes quite similar but it's less sweet. Really recommend it!Service was alright, it was kind of slow getting our food and drinks but the ambiance is totally worth it. You get to drink under the warm sun, Moose gets a ton of pets from strangers (he's a total ham), and the vibe of the restaurant is great. I am coming back here for sure!"

I went there for breakfast and it was hard to decide but I went with my usual selection: Chilaquiles and I had no regrets. We also got pancakes and they tasted very home made and delish!

            "I'm super confused by the poor reviews for this place, as we found the atmosphere, food and service to be excellent.    While camping at Costanoa, we decided to eat out versus cooking in our camping trailer. We made a reservation on OpenTable, walked over, and were promptly seated upon arrival.  We did get a fabulous table for 2, right in front of the fireplace.  Once seated, we ordered Brussels sprouts to start (without cheese), and they were fantastic.  We both ordered the garden salad and LOVED the dressing. It was fantastic, and the greens were crisp and fresh.  Then, for entrees I got a pasta dish and my partner got the seasonal fish.  Both were excellent, prepared very well, temperature was fantastic and timing was perfect.  We had the chocolate pudding for dessert, which was basically a chocolate mousse.  Delicious.Service was prompt, attentive and very good.  Perhaps big groups struggle here, but we were very happy with our experience.  Even better, we walked back to our camping trailer for the night, and were very content.",
            "We arrived for our reservation about 20 minutes early and was told our table would be ready in 5 minutes. No problem..not a rush!We were seated at a table where there was a bright yellow/orange stain on the paper they place on the table over the table cloth. Looking under the plate that from the top appeared freshly washed with small droplets of water, there was a huge glob of whatever that yellow/orange stuff was. So first impression, they're not doing a good job at basic cleanliness.We were moved to a table directly in-front of the fireplace. Im leaving 2 stars only because the waiter was nice but the food was sub par.We ordered a dozen oysters where at least 7 of the 12 had lots of grit and shells. We didn't finish the last 3 (which Ive never done) as the quality of the oysters we pretty poor even despite the grit and shells.We ordered the \"surf and turf\" which from the description should have been nice. But it was an oversized potato chip with a bland chopped egg topping and caviar that had no flavor and was rationed off like it was the last of it.We ordered the steak for 2 and although the waiter brought over another waiter holding the \"house accoutrement\" which ended up being sea salt, the steak was of poor quality, fatty and was medium rather than the rare we asked for. It came with potatoes that had \"some sauce\" on it but was bland. The salad it came with was good because well it was just greens tossed in a light vinaigrette (cant mess that up)Really disappointed but it was the only place open late in the evening in the area.Do yourself a favor, order a cheeseburger or something because you will not have a fine dining experience or barely a good dining experience here as my stomach felt queasy all night (I blame the sub-par oysters)",
            "We stayed at Costanoa lodge for two nights and ate at Cascade for dinner and brunch-great food and service both times!The dinner was a celebratory birthday dinner on a Thursday night and we made a reservation through Open Table. We had the steak (shared portion) which came with potatoes, green salad and a purée of some sort that was delicious. Steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly! Also came with complementary *warm* bread and butter. Wine selection wasn't large but is well curated. We had rosé and a Gamay-both excellent. Finished our meal with a sundae and moved to the bar area to watch the end of a Warriors game. The next day we had breakfast/brunch. My partner got ricotta pancakes and I got a breakfast plate with eggs, potatoes and bacon. Everything was delicious! Service was fantastic and only critique would be that the ambiance and pricing is really for a special occasion. Would be nice during the week if they had a more casual menu with lower price point. Especially at breakfast time, would be nice to have smaller (oatmeal, breakfast sandwich) or to-go items.A great gem of a restaurant and glad we got to try it during our stay at Costanoa!"

Everyone cheers!  There is always a pitcher of icy water with lemon on the table and they bring you your own pot of coffee! This place is a winner!

            "Update 3/27/19I went here the other morning with my wife, this has always been one of the more decent breakfast spots in pacifica! They arent amazing but they are definately one of the best spots in town as pacifica doesnt have many good options for breakfast.I ordered the chorizo 3 egg scramble and was not really happy with it. It was dry and full of olives. Olives are my least favorite food in the entire world so it was my own fault for not checking the menu ingredients but either way it was such a weird ingredient to have. The chorizo had no flavor. There was a hair in my salsa that came with my plate  that I didn't find until i poured over my hash browns. They were very friendly about replacing them. Some places get so rude about it so i really appreciated that, i underatand accidents happen to so that wont keep me from coming back either. I just think i ordered the wrong thing for me so next time i will get something else.My wife  ordered a omelette which she loved and she highly reccomends them. I usually get the eggs Benedict. One thing i dont like that they do is leave pitchers of water out. It feels lazy and all the ice is melted at every table because they dont keep up on it when they are slow. If they are going to do that they should fill them up WHEN you get there. Breakers is a pretty good breakfast spot though and you should try it!",

            "Overall decent food but not anything worth going out of the way for. They serve burgers on sandwich bread. We ordered the mushroom sandwich, beef sandwich, and house made chips. I think the chips were definitely unique and worth trying. Both mushroom and beef sandwiches were tasty, but for price and yelp reviews I expected more.",
            "Nice find.  We were headed to an Italian restaurant and then choked on the prices on Main Street. Then we found this place instead.  Its definitely not your typical luncheonette.The hubs had the burger sandwich.  It's on two pieces of toasted bread rather than a burger bun.  Different. I ordered the mushroom sandwich.  Also not what I expected.  There are full morsels of mushrooms in there - not the chopped up patty kind.  It was flavorful.  I held the aioli but can imagine how much more flavorful that would have been if the sandwich had it.  There were also either picked onions or grilled onions.  I couldn't tell.The kids mac and cheese was toddler approved.  It was just plain mac and cheese but had a smokey flavor to it. The chips again were not what I expected. They were homemade and sprinkled with some stuff on it.  Not too salty and perfectly crisp. It was good.  All in all, a fun experience.  It will add grease to your arteries, for sure.  Some folks suggested taking it to go and eating it on the beach somewhere.  That is a great idea.Extra tip:  the restrooms are in the building next door.  You need a key to get into them so you may have to ask the neighboring businesses."

This morning when I was headed to a walk for people affected by a rare disease and decided to stop for some coffee on the way. I asked a question about the sizes of the cups and coffee that they served. Despite these being a normal new costumer question and despite me asking in a polite, friendly manner, I was met with extreme attitude. The man with the red hair acted as if I had horribly wasted his time, ignored my question, and was very irritated he had to sell me coffee. Not surprisingly (since he ignored me and was arrogant), he picked up the wrong size cup. When I pointed out that I wanted a different size (the one I was physically pointing at while asking the question he ignored), he became even more annoyed and barked \"what size DO you want?\" I paid for my coffee in silence. When I proceeded to ask only 1 additional question (where is the dark roast?), the amount of attitude I received from him escalated. I calmly explained that it was my first time at the coffee shop and asking a few questions was not unreasonable. Don't come here since I would hate for you to waste this man's time purchasing coffee at a coffee shop!"

            "Half Moon Bay really needs a great seafood restaurant, which is what PPFH aspires to be. We are rooting for them, and we were encouraged by our first visit. It took a few minutes for them to seat us, as they are understaffed and a new restaurant. Maybe 5-8 minutes. After we were seated, we ordered the mussels and frites, an abalone slider, and the cod fritters (or bolinhos de bacalhau, as they wrote it in Portuguese). All three were delicious! Before our food arrived, we were feeling a bit annoyed about the slightly long wait to be seated, but the quality of the food erased those feelings.For dessert, we had New Orleans-style beignets, with chocolate, strawberry and condensed milk (or white chocolate?) toppings. Two thumbs up.I hope they can hire more staff, because that seems to be the missing piece of the puzzle. The food is great, so please don't change that!",
            "Had a couple steaks, one with mashed potatoes and one with garlic bread, a Caesar salad and a butterleaf lettuce salad. Everything was cooked perfectly as requested and tasted fantastic. The service was also amazing. Maybe we got lucky, but I couldn't have asked for a better experience.P.S. the beignets are to die for",
            "Stopped in today to enjoy a break in the rain on the outside patio. Enjoyed a beautifully presented cup of artichoke soup which was piping hot and delicious. I prefer a vibrant artichoke flavor and light, but not overwhelming creaminess and this dish fit the bill. Shared an order of \"nachos\" with ahi, edamame and pineapple on wonton crisps. I didn't think I would like the pineapple but it was the perfect compliment. The ahi was fresh and the dish thoughtfully prepared. I would probably order the poke next time instead to stave off the heaviness factor of the nachos but that is just preference. The service was excellent- attentive and informative. The menu is extensive which made for a hard time choosing. Would be okay with less choices, but again, preference.Definitely will return and encourage friends and neighbors to visit and support our newest restaurant."

            "Do you like sticks?Do you like Steam?Well if you answered \"yes\" to both questions, then Stick and Steam is the place for you!...lol I'm stupid.This is a very small restaurant - came here on a Thursday around 1:00PM and it was a full house, so I can't imagine the wait on a weekend. Heard that a relative of the owner of Koi Palace opened this spot - and I notice that their XLB's are pretty similar! Salted Egg Yolk Fries: sounds delicious, but wasn't very impressive. I expected it to be extremely flavorful and packed with salted egg yolk, but it was very mild. Pretty good though if you just tell me they're regular fries lolSkewers:-Pork Belly: super fatty and melt-in-your-mouth good. The meat part was a tiny bit too tough for my liking but it's really good for what it is. The flavors were all there.-Chicken Wings: BOMB! I highly recommend getting this! Tasted liKe sweet soy wings -Chicken Cartilage: not your typical chicken cartilage - this one reminds me of the chicken knee skewers that I love getting in Japan, except this one had teriyaki sauce on it and I very much prefer salt & pepper. Very fatty pieces of cartilage (except it's a bit too sweet for me)-Chicken Heart: it came out looking dry but it was surprisingly soft and tasty! If you're a heart lover I recommend thisXiao Long Bao: same ones from Koi Palace. Super juicy and delicious.Hainanese Chicken Rice Plate: BONELESS CHICKEN? Sign me up!!! Pretty decent Hainan Chicken with yellow rice and the bombass ginger/scallion sauce! I thought it was pretty good, but the portion is on the smaller end. I'd definitely recommend ordering appetizers/skewers to go with this so you can leave full and happy.Kumquat Lemon Green Tea: just tasted like regular lemon green tea to me, didn't have a kumquat \"punch\" to it. Requested for less sweet and it was perfectly refreshing.",
            "My wife and I went there early on a Thursday and waited for the doors to open. Ordered the lamb skewer, chicken wings skewer, pork belly with charcoal bun combo as well as 1/2 Hainan chicken.  Not a lot of food for the money. Service was attentive and efficient though.Best dish was the Hainan chicken, followed by 4 grilled pieces of pork belly. The rest was ordinary. Maybe next time we will try something else on the menu.",
            "Their signature main dish is the Hainan chicken with rice. The chicken was okay but the rice was not the best I've had. Mediocre.They also have grilled skewers. Pretty extensive menu with a lot of asian snacks. We also had the Xiaolongbao and Siumai. Both were okay.Price was affordable.Service was kinda lack tho. They just deliver the food and bring you the check. Didn't ask if we need water until we asked for it.Will try something else on my next visit."

            "This place is a hidden gem if you don't know about it. I was planning a birthday lunch for myself and needed a place to take a large group of people. A friend told me that he had been here before for another party and it was good experience. The start, the drive way is from hell. If you drive anything remotely lowered, you will scrape if you don't go at an angle or my car is just stupid low. I had to park in front of the restaurant on the street which was fine.When we finally got in when they opened up, they seated our large party fair quickly. I believe there was 15 or 17 of us and they had a table already setup. I would recommend that you set a reservation ahead of time so they know how many people are coming. When you set the reservation for a large party, they keep very good contact with you for the upcoming event. They had sent over a menu and listed what would be prepared ahead of time when your party gets there so that you're not waiting for food for too long. I believe we had about 8-10 dishes prepared ahead of time so we only had to wait about 5 minutes before food started to come out.After the starter dishes get sent out, you can finally open up that menu and start marking what you want. We got there when they first opened so our service was fast. We ordered large amounts of sashimi which came out fresh and on these large boats that fill the table. That was a cool sight to see.All the food was good and decent quality for sushi. They accommodated our large party with good service. I would host a party here again no problem.",
            "[ Long story short - one of the rolls had rotten fish]. Very disappointing. I've been coming here 2-3 times a year and always had a good experience. The lunch menu was (in 2017-2018) $31 all you can eat sushi (on the weekend) and the menu is varied (hot dishes, cold plates, sushi). Came in today with friends for the first time in a few months. I wish I didn't. It started with the smell. I don't know if it's the old carpet or the rain outside making everything inside smell that way but it was very off putting. Next to our window seat, there was yellow rotten foam insulation. Is it toxic? It really should be cleaned up. In our first order, the fish was good (fresh and tasty) but the rice was undercooked. The second order then came. Halfway through, I realize the scallop in the spicy scallop roll is yellow (not white). We take turns to smell the fish. It was bad. Actually fish-gone bad-do NOT serve to customers- bad. We stopped eating. I told our waitress about the fish and showed it to her and she said it was normal, bla-bla-bla this is how it is prepared and maybe we just don't like it prepped that way. Please show me a customer that enjoys eating raw fish that has gone bad and I will take this review down. Do NOT try to make me believe that it's the preparation of the fish that is the issue. I had to insist to have a discount (which is really a gesture of good faith from the restaurant side) and they begrudgingly priced the roll at $5 and removed it from the bill. Side note on the itemized menu, it it $7. And to top it off, they increased their lunch price  from $31 to $41. Absurd. I hope none of us gets sick tonight.",
            "Found this place on yelp and looked through the pictures and saw beautiful massive plates of nigiri... was deceived because there is a maximum number you can order per person... so for 2 people-- our plates and orders per round did not look like those pictures... and also you can't order the next round until after all your things come out and you finish itHonestly this matters a lot because personally I like to have a good amount of food infront of me when I'm paying for AYCE. By limiting the amount you can order, it makes the process of eating not as efficient because you literally eat for like 5 minutes and then have to order more and having to wait 10-15min for it to come out.Sitting around for so long made me really full after like the second round.. this is why I believe that Monster Chef is not a great AYCE spot to get bang for your buck. Might as well get sushi ordered by plate at a nice restaurant.But on the bright side-- I did really enjoy their salmon belly nigiri!"

            "Came here after an afternoon at Stinson Beach. We were planning on just stopping by to drink some wine and maybe buy a bottle to take to dinner with us later (we had reservations at another restaurant). Ended up cancelling that reservation and staying at Eleven since the wine list was *fire*, the atmosphere was cozy and the other couple sitting at the bar had a pizza that looked very tasty.Saw a big bowl of olives on the bar and asked for an order. The bartender told us to help ourselves. OMG free olives??? OMG and they're actually delicious too???We ordered:Kumamoto & sweet water oystersBurrata with early girl tomatoes, basil, focaccia, balsamic/olive oil Special: Whole roasted branzino with french fries Pizza: spicy sausageBuffalo milk soft serve. Ordered two as affogatos. I devoured mine and started eating my husbands order.. then my friends... and seriously seriously thought about ordering myself another one.It's not a huge menu and the dishes are simple but everything came out well executed and the ingredients were fresh.Will definitely be back when I'm in the area. Side note: This place only serves natural wine. Good for me because I only drink natural wine. Read a negative review about this place and they were complaining about the wine. Didn't like natural wine when I first tried it but now it's the only kind of wine I drink. IGNORE the negative review, TRY some natty wine and keep an open mind about it."

            "Came here last night: it was cool. 35 dollars an hour per lane. Astro Fridays though are their 'disco light' days?",
            "We've been coming to Sea Bowl for several years. It's reliably clean, you can almost always go bowling without having to wait for an open lane and there's plenty of parking in their private lot.But the lane charges? It's becoming the reason to go spend money elsewhere.And today they greedily raised the hourly rate from $40 to $45 because of the MLK holiday.Add in shoe rentals, buying time so five kids can hurriedly bowl a couple of games, food, soda and the arcade, you're looking at $175. Ouch.And they must get rid of the tip feature on the credit card reader. There's no option to decline (I chafed then meekly hit 15% the first time I encountered it). Hit zero to clear it. I tip well. I tip 20-25% at the grill but to tip when you're renting the lane and shoes? That's a \"no\".All that said, there are many great things about Sea Bowl: family fun; decent bar with terrific fire-grilled cheeseburgers, pizzas and bomb onion rings; an arcade to bid farewell to a roll or two of quarters; well-maintained and clean.Plus, the staff is always pleasant, especially VJ who deftly moves among the lanes cleaning up spilled soda, helping people set the score-keeping board or retrieve a wayward bowling ball. He has a sunny personality and takes such pride in his work. Sea Bowl, I like you lots but you'd make more money from customers like me who'd come more often if the prices were lower and you had a loyalty program.",
            "I've been coming to Sea Bowl since I was a small fry.  My parents bowled league here for numerous years while I used to hang out at the arcade.  This was all before the remodel and what a difference it made.  This spot pretty much has everything you need in a bowling alley.  You've got tons of lanes, a huge eating area, a decent arcade, and a pro shop.  I went early on a weekday and the price was $3/game.  Not bad in comparison to other bowling alleys in the Bay Area although I miss those 99 cent games.  That's long gone.The lanes look like they're well kept although they were extremely dry when we went.  The bathrooms bugged me though.  How can you not have paper towels in a bathroom in a bowling alley?  Bowling with semi wet hands is dangerous and not ideal.  Otherwise, you just need to sit there and wait til your hands dry.  Anyhoo, parking is plentiful and I like the updates."

            "Great spot for izakaya (Japanese tapas) and yakitori (grilled skewers). And, oh my goodness, the ambiance is chic! They have the sunken floor seating a.k.a. horigotatsu, and I love how the red cushions contrast against the dark wooden floors and tables. In addition, they have a whole shelf of sake and shochu. For those who don't know, shochu is Japan's notable distilled liquor and can be made from sweet potato, rice, or barley. We opted for the yuzu shochu and the green tea shochu cocktails. I highly recommend the yuzu shochu cocktail since it's the perfect balance of sour and sweet and goes down nicely.Food-wise, the grilled whole squid (ika sugata yaki) with spicy Japanese mayo and the wagyu beef are a must. If you're looking for something different, I would also recommend the monkfish liver and the fried kawa (crispy chicken skin). And if you're looking for something really different, they serve exotic meats on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Some things I wasn't crazy about: I didn't feel like there was much variety in sauces. The monkfish liver, oysters, and fried kawa all used the same sauce (ponzu?). The spicy garlic miso ramen was neither spicy, nor flavorful; just oily. Still, I would recommend checking it out for the ambiance alone. It's one of the few places that actually have the horigotatsu seating and it's got a sizeable selection of liquor, izakaya, and yakitori to enjoy. Bring some friends. You get a free bottle of sake if you have a group of four or more and show up after 11 PM.",
            "We really wanted to like this place for the cute, intimate ambiance and large selection of alcohol and food but service was just too mediocre. I'll start with the positives, everything we ordered was fairly good and the food runner was friendly. We opted for the bacon wrapped quail eggs, beef tendon, potato croquette, duck breast, pork belly, kurobota sausage and another that I forgot. The sausage was supposedly spicy but it tasted pretty normal, and the pork belly was overly chewy. We really liked the tako wasabi though, I definitely recommend that.Our waitress tonight was a girl with blue contacts who seemed cold and uninviting to start. I felt the weird vibe when she answered all my questions super awkwardly, especially when I asked about the free beer with check-in. She didn't seem knowledgable about the menu nor did she check up on us, ask if we wanted to order more food/drinks, or deliver the check. I asked her what chicken gristle was since it's on the menu and she just said \"Uhh I don't know.\" I know that japanese restaurants sometimes do pooled tip and everyone has equal responsibility over all the tables so maybe it was just an off night. But I definitely shouldn't get the vibe that I'm bothering my server when I ask to order 2 more things lolI also don't wanna complain about free beer but they were extremely flat and came to our table looking like someone already drank both. No foam whatsoever and the cup was missing like an inch from the top, wish I took a picture. All in all the experience was a little too meh for us to return",
            "Located less than 10 mins from the airport this is a must dine spot in the area. It's traditional with no shoes and  seating tatami floors. They feature these large thick glass walls as dividers between diners. My friend and I shared the tonkatsu ramen, beef tongue, snake, boars skewers, and takoyaki. The ramen was perfect with thick noodles and a strong broth. Not too salty with 2 thick cuts of pork and an gooey egg. Wednesday- Thursday night they have specials on the exotic animals so we decided to give them a try. The snake and boar skewers we're interesting. Tough meat perfectly grilled and provided great texture. My friend and I definitely enjoyed our experience here. The menu has all types of meats, soups and entrees to choose from. Taste wise it's very authentic and fairly priced. If you love Japanese and yakitori this is the spot!"

Shared a Caesar salad which was also up to par - very fresh.Extensive wine list with many Italian wines (bit overpriced) but also many local wines and very reasonable house wines. Specialty house cocktail not much to write home about.",
            "Came here on a Sunday night with the hubby. Our waiter was extremely nice and attentive. We ordered a couple of drinks after he recommended a nice wine to go alone with my steak. For appetizer we had the calamari, it was average, my husband said it had a certain smell to it which he didn't enjoy but I though it was ok. My husband ordered a pasta which was a little bland for our taste. I ordered a steak, cooked how I like it but the plate seemed a little oily, not sure if it was due to the chimichurry sauce. We had finished our drinks and decided to get a bottle of the moscato my husband had, the waiter brought out the bottle and poured us each a glass. It wasn't until I had a sip of the drink that I realized that it was the wrong drink, I brought it up to our waiter who immediately apologized and brought us the correct bottle. Lastly for dessert we had the lava cake and creme burlee those were amazing! Overall the service was a solid 4 star, appetizer and main dish were a solid 3 stars and the desserts were a solid 5 star.",
            "At first impression I thought would be just another American/Italian restaurant due to building appearance from outside.As I ordered my appetizer things started to change.The presentation was great and tasty followed by main entree which was very well prepared.I also learned the building is an old part of town and was remodeled to its current looks.Staff was 10 out of 10."

            "We had SUCH a great meal when we were in Half Moon Bay over New Years. We didn't have reservations but they found us a cute, quiet table tucked away. Service was attentive but not overbearing and the owner even stopped us on our way out to make sure everything had been okay.We shared the eggplant parmesan and a daily special - mushroom and scallop risotto. Both were great. We liked everything so much we actually stopped by later in the week to grab a pizza to go and I will say it wasn't as good as our dinner. So, I'd recommend either staying away from the pizza or just not trying takeout. It didn't travel very well!",
            "Excellent!The owner came over to say hi and check on us, and I thought that that was very nice of her to do, and a classy move!The table bread they give is DELICIOUS. It's a soft, wheat-type bread and soooooo good. I couldn't eat enough.  :DI liked, and appreciated, how when one of us finished our food, the server left that empty plate until the other person was finished. I can't stand when servers whisk away an empty plate even if others at the table are eating! It's always a mark of a quality restaurant when the servers know to leave the empty plates until everyone is finished.Minus one star because of two different pasta dishes, both were a bit on the small side. Yummy, though....just a small portion of both. I'm there to fill my tummy!I will definitely go back....especially for that tasty soft wheat bread. SO GOOD.",
            "Ceasar: yawn. Tagliatelle: pretty great. Cioppini: average. Service: totally fine. So I'd give the food 3.5/4. The reason this review is 3 instead of 4, however, is to do with their facilities. One of their bathrooms were out of service. The wait was long and peopled were infuriated. Total buzzkill. For a crowded restaurant to only have one working restroom on a busy Friday night tells me the folks who run this place don't care much for their clients. Might not be true, but that's the message I received. Try harder, Pasta Moon."

It's definitely great after a long day out on the trails or drive through the California hills.Alice's is, and has been for a long time, the home of the motorcycle and car meet. Come here on a weekend or a holiday and you're bound to run into more than a handful of car clubs already parked up and hogging the tables inside. It's part of the charm of Alice's and I suppose it's maybe an issue if you're not much of a petrol head.On weekdays it's a hell of a lot quieter in the middle of the day. If you want to avoid waiting in line on a weekend you're going to have to get there at opening time when there will be tables but it'll still already have 20-30 folks seated inside.",
            "Alice's is one of those rare places that has a lock on a primo location; and with no serious, nearby competition.  And because they are the only game in town (if that town is upper Woodside) they consistently fill their seats on the weekends. If it's a nice day, parking will disappear early and there'll be a waiting list for breakfast, brunch and lunch.You'd think such a place would let the food quality slide, but it's actually still pretty decent. I've enjoyed their buffalo burger and the nachos are surprisingly well-executed. The beer list could be longer but they have a few good choices. I'd give the food & drink 3.5 stars max. My main issues here have been with aforementioned crowds and the service, the latter having slid downhill in the last few years. I've had my food delivered to the wrong table (with the error discovered too late), I've been served warm beers, and I've waited ten minutes for a beer, even when dining solo a mere 8 feet from the bar (and after having to remind the waitress).My other complaint is that they no longer will set aside space for larger groups.  It used to be we could reserve a spot for a group of 25 hungry and thirsty hikers here in the late afternoon, thereby avoiding the lunch and dinner rushes. But Alice's no longer wants to bother with that. I suppose they don't really need to, since they have plenty of business (and are probably raking it in). So we now drive down the hill to get our beer and burgers. Shame.On the positive side, Alice's is one of the better spots to people-watch on the weekends. Here you'll see daytrippers and tourists mixing with locals, road bikers, car club enthusiasts, hikers, and motorcycle groups. And anyone in those sets might include some retired, incognito silicon valley multi-millionaires (good luck trying to spot them).I used to enjoy frequent trips to Alice's, but with the crowds, the worsening service and the resistance to groups, my likelihood of returning here has diminished. Thus the rating downgrade.",

            "Nick's will forever be woven into the narrative of the fun day we spent in Montara Bay with our funny and interesting friend who works in a local Art Gallery and kept raving about his favorite Crab Sandwich at Nick's. Neither of us had ever tried a Crab Sandwich and honestly had no reference point for it. So, to Nick's in Pacifica we drove and ordered one each.We sat in the bar as there was a wait for dining room seating in the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday. Nick's parking lot is pretty much on the beach. The buildings here feel like they were built in the 70s or earlier and have not been updated. There's a classic charm in it. But, it's not like the Bay Area, where everything feels updated and manicured.Bar seating was around small tables with the sun shining brightly in off the ocean across the parking lot. Our crab sandwiches came fairly quickly and were delicious. Butter fried sour bread with a lightly seasoned crab salad filling, tomato and lettuce. It would be very easy to overstate the flavor of a salad like this. The purity of the crab flavor, unsauced, was reflective of the area to me. I'd expect such a sandwich in Texas to be \"enhanced\" with lots of seasoning or an aoli-like dressing. But this crab sandwich is unapologetically Dungeness in it's nature.I never asked for a menu and was surprised when the check came listing the $28 price tag. But, eh. It's Dungeness on the peninsula. And, it was a great memory.",
            "Three stars is basically a gift.  Service was very good. Food not so much.  Seems to be a favorite with locals and is right on a parking lot on the beach. Stopped for lunch on way to Half Moon Bay as they were still serving breakfast and the place was really busy.I started with a Siracha Bloody Mary which was ok and had a shrimp with the usual olive, celery, etc. but $13.Wife had chewy spongy pancakes, unscrambled scrimpBled eggs and bacon which was too hard to bite.  I had crab cake \"Benedict\" with not Bernaise but some kind of cheese sauce. Eggs were cooked just fine but crab was scarce for $20. We won't be back. Sorry",
            "Update 3/23/19: My dad gave me a giftcard here the other day so me and my wife swung by for dinner! I ordered the california burger and she ordered the crab sandwich that nicks is known for. We both got pickle fries with our sandwiches. I LOVE thier pickle fries, it was such a great addition to thier menu. I only wish they would give more like they used to, there where only like 5 of them on the plate and you have to spend an extra $2 on a already high price tag to get them. The california burger said it had sprouts on it which was also one reason i ordered that instead another option but they described it wrong.  It actually came with arugula. They do make the best burger in town however!I ordered my food to go and was also a little bothered by the waiter who checked me out. He implied i should leave a tip, but i usually never tip on a togo order i dont feel its necessary and thought it was very rude of him to ask.I dont come to nicks alot because of the high prices, maybe like 3 times a year, but every time i eat here i am pretty satisfied."

Watching the sunset after a long day was the perfect remedy to a long wonderful weekend and a perfect set up for the coming busy work week.The food was really good! The oysters were creamy and huge and really delicious! No shells or grit, perfectly shucked!The filet mignon was perfectly cooked rare and a of great quality!The staff was friendly and the service was great!Our server was sweet and attentive and we never felt rushed or unwanted! Great service all around!The restaurant has so much history and they provide you with a print out which I took with me, I won't spoil it but its just really cool! Definitely worth the trip for a date night or special occasion!",
            "Rainy March Sat made a reservation for 4:45pm, was off season and not crowded.  The small bar area had 2 tv with basketball game on.  The porch outside had a gas fire pit with lava rocks.  We arrived 15min early, but seated immediately.  They have a children's menu and crayons to draw on the paper table cover, was a good touch for families.  The small bowl of clam chowder was thick and tasty, great for the rainy weather, some grittiness on the bottom, but was fine.  The large kale and quinoa salad was enough to share with 4 people or take home.  The pulled pork tacos were just ok, a bit too much shredded lettuce.  The sour dough bread rolls were fresh and chewy was perfect match for soup and salad.     The kids meal 2 mini burgers were the same as the devil's sliders without the extra  aioli, bacon, mushroom, and onion option.  Upgraded to the sweet potato fries were crispy and plentiful for leftovers or sharing.     Dessert was the $10 chocolate fudge cake with whipped cream was not baked same day fresh had a dry refrigerated texture, but our kid loved it.     Agreed the food is just ok and pricey, but the view and friendly service, we would come again on another winter off season.",
            "Oh how I love this place!  The BEST seafood quesadilla ever!   And according to my husband the pulled pork rancheros were amazing.  Sunday Brunch is our favorite.  We love that it's a laid back place with great food.  Endless mimosas on Sunday!Get there early and request a window seat.  Nothing like sitting on the edge of the Pacific Ocean while having brunch!"

            "What an excellent find, entering downtown HMB for the first time!  It was an odd hour at 2ish to be seeking ailment.  Sacrilege popped up on my Yelp radar and looked most enticing.It's an \"order-at-the-counter-seat-yourself\" deal with a number and getting the food delivered by a super friendly team member.  The beer list has something for everyone: stouts, ciders, IPA's etc.  Wine is available also.  They offer a basic variety of American fare some more healthier than others.  We were up for some bites.  Artichoke hearts were a new one for us, and Sacrilege hit the spot with these delectable, lightly breaded gems.  The outer portion complimented the tastiness of the hearts inside.  The grass-fed chili was as amazing as it looks.  Fries were thin and good also - just wasn't hot on the mayonnaise dip. The sriracha cream cheese dip that came with the hearts was better but kind of heavy for my taste. I would come through here again for another hearty cup of chili, some brew and to try more bites.  The atmosphere is quite jovial and full of vibrancy - one worthy of future visits!",
            "Half Moon Bay is such a happy hamlet that finding excuses for excursions here don't require that much incentive for me. Usually a walk along one of the oceanfront trails followed by a light lunch would do me just fine for a weekend respite. Finding a scenic trail is not the difficult part, but a good lunch can become a hit-or-miss affair if you have my Yelp-driven tendency to try something different each time you visit these parts. That's what led me to Sacrilege. Not a purportedly vile act of secularism but a brewpub on Main Street.This was most definitely a brewpub because most of the focus was on the beer - at least fifteen on tap, four of which are brewed in-house, and a seemingly endless variety in cans. Food took a back seat, and frankly it may even be in the trunk. The one staff person taking the orders in front couldn't speak to the food with much clarity when I asked about ingredients in the dishes offered. However, it wouldn't be for lack of effort in the kitchen. They need to keep refining it and explain what they did to the rest of the staff. Take for example, the $8 bowl of their Cali Clam Chowder.It was an admirable cream-free, tomato-free concoction that used fish stock instead but somehow fell short on flavor, appearance, and satisfaction. A plus was the toasted wedges of French bread for easy dipping (photo: bit.ly/2GZ6tIJ). I also tried a daily special, the $16 Caprese Salad with Chicken which was an odd presentation of an old standby as it looked like a toppled Napoleon with the tomatoes decidedly unripened and the grilled chicken breast somewhat overpowering the rest (photo: bit.ly/2GZK26i). Guess I'll come back for the beer if there is a next time.FOOD - 3 stars...nice try but execution still needed workAMBIANCE - 3 stars...yep, it's a brewpub...in a houseSERVICE - 2.5 stars...more staff training may be neededTOTAL - 3 stars...I'll probably just keep walking down Main Street.RELATED - Looking for dining options on the peninsula? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed: bit.ly/2KWj9yk",
            "While visiting two friends down in the Bay area, we made our way to Half Moon Bay for the afternoon. They brought me to Sacrilege Brewery + Kitchen and it did not disappoint. They have a nice variety of both indoor and outdoor seating, high tops and classic tables. They also had some couches and chairs for a more relaxed vibe. The TVs all had the college playoff football matches on, which I enjoyed watching as we sipped our beers and caught up.Besides a nice variety of beers (they even had a sour that I loved), we munched on some pretzels with beer cheese (yum!) and some french fries. The pretzels with beer cheese were absolutely delicious and we could have easily devoured another order or two more of those. The fries were fries. Nothing special there.I really enjoyed the atmosphere on this place and the fact that they carry such a wide variety of beers on tap; everything from stouts and IPAs, to blondes and sours. My new favorite brewery to visit in the Half Moon Bay area."

            "Been here maybe 4-5 times and for a place that has poke in its name, you think I would've tried it by now.. but nope. For me their ace is their garlic fried chicken. Masubi, rice plate, loco moco, whatever -- you just absolutely need to try their GFC. IDK if that's a thing but I'm gonna call it that now bc garlic fried chicken is such a long thing to type haha. It's perfectly juicy yet crunchy, has just the right amount of garlic, and the serving size is enough to fill me and sometimes even leave me with leftovers. WOOOORTH IT. I feel like I say this a lot because there really is nothing going on in San Bruno, but this is a much needed addition to the area. It's modern, clean, and spacious which I think you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere in that part of downtown. Overall, super excited to have this place in my 'hood! Promise I'll try poke the next time I come back..which will probably be super soon hehe.",
            "When I think of Sam Choy and Hawaii, what comes to mind are two things: great food, and a welcoming environment with customer service that encompasses the Ohana spirit. The San Bruno Sam Choy's Poke To The Max, while having great food, falls extremely short in the customer service metric.  I will explain why I felt overlooked and ultimately made to feel awkward given my expressed excitement about coming in to eat here yesterday.  Yesterday afternoon, I walked in really happy that a Sam Choy's was here in San Bruno and I greeted the two young ladies at the counter. I have to admit I was quite enthusiastic about being there and explained I was new and it was my first time ordering. One of the female cashiers was training a new employee, another female. Both didn't make eye contact not greet me with a welcome. They were both just very serious, stoic, no smiles and just so cold, it seemed.  What led me to further feel this way was that the cashier trainer was reluctant to answer my questions about the different food items. I admit I did have alot of questions because I was new and hoping to establish a relationship for future business both personal and for catering, but the young lady training the new girl made me feel like I was an annoyance and being very short and snippy with her answers to my questions. I even had to ask again for clarification which was met with the same apathy towards me.  The way that I was made to feel was a barometer indicating bad customer service, especially because I had a preconceived notion of Ohana and Aloha spirit. The impression that I got was that they wanted me to just order my food and leave.These concerns of poor customer engagement and service are not unfounded.  I am a travel and service professional whose specialty is to cater to high value customers for my global company. I know what I'm talking about: I know how to be kind to people, I know how to engage with customers and certainly how not make them feel bad for asking questions, and I know how to treat people very well to ensure repeat business. It just really sucks when I am on the other side of the counter and don't get the basic service given to me as a customer.I truly hope these two young ladies are retrained to exhibit Hawaiian values of Ohana and Aloha spirit.Finally to make things worse, my to-go order was not correct. I ordered a Classic Poke platter to take to my mom and was given Spicy Poke.  My mom doesnt eat spicy, so that was another loss for me. I called the restaurant and I explained that my order was wrong and the girl said that someone would call me back to correct the error.  As of yet, no one has called me back.",
            "The name of the restaurant kind of throws you off. I am not a fan of poke at all, but once I found out that they have other food, I decided to give it a try.They have so much more besides poke. They have a whole Hawaiian menu. So far I've tried the garlic fried chicken, Korean fried chicken, and BBQ short ribs. All were very good. The to-go plate they give is deceptive. It's actually a lot of food.Their macaroni salad is okay. I've had better, but it's definitely not bad.Overall, nice, clean place. Very friendly, with good food."

            "This place is really good. It's not marketed anywhere and basically a word of mouth place. The chef is the previous chef of Yume, and most of his customers here are ones that used to go there before it closed. The only way to reserve is to message him or the business on Facebook as there isn't a phone to call and no website. Kind of hard to find, because it's inside of another restaurant. Look for Impressions and walk upstairs and it is literally a bar counter. A little strange to be sure, but that doesn't really matter - you're here for the fish (and the view), not the ambiance.Look, you may be hesitant to spend the $100 on a restaurant with no reviews and seemingly no way to make a reservation. And I wouldn't blame you. But this is a place that could get a star and Tsuyoshi really loves his craft. Ask him how he even got this place as it's an impressive story. Seriously, this is Japan-level quality.",
            "I've bookmarked Yume in Alameda for a while but never got a chance to go and heard that they closed. I found this place from the old Yume Yelp and I'm so glad I tried it out. This place is located inside of the Impressions restaurant, 2nd floor. I made reservation through their Facebook page. Plenty of parking and the view is gorgeous! Usually when you do omakase, they will serve you with some soups and light appetizer plus dessert. Here, it's strictly nigiri. You get 12pcs of nigiri for $90 and you can order extra supplements if you'd like. The nigiri is pretty big so we were full after the 12 pcs and only ordered extra toro. Love all the fish we tried and love all the background story about where the fish is from and some history on why he opened this place. I wish they give some dessert in the end, but other than that, we're satisfied with our meal!",
            "Amazing 12-piece Omakase Nigiri Dinner presented by Tsuyoshi \"Andrew\" Kamogawa, son of Hideki (owner of Yume in Alameda). If you're looking for the \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" experience, go here. You do not get to pick anything but your alcohol (unless you have a food allergy that the Chef can accommodate). Think Seinfeld's Soup Nazi but nicer. You sit and you eat what you're fed. You do not get soy sauce, additional wasabi, but have pickled ginger to cleanse your palates with. We were not disappointed! Andrew described each item he fed us, why certain pairings were made, origin of the fish, etc. Made a special sauce to top all the Nigiri with. Not only were we full at the end of the meal, we asked for more of certain items (for an extra fee of course). All the fish fresh from Japan delivered that morning! This is not a meal meant for the regular Moe. It is an experience to savor what Japan has to offer close to the Bay Area.If you are a picky eater, don't come. If you need to bring your kids, don't come. If you drown your sushi in sauce, don't come. If you don't want to pay top dollars for top notch sushi, don't come.Leave the slots available for us who can enjoy it!This place is reservations only. Reservations requires contacting Andrew on Facebook. You cannot call or book online. Note that there are only 8 seats & currently 5 slots available each week (Fri & Sat at 5 & 7:30 pm; Sun at 3 pm)"

            "Decent food if the staff decides they want to make it. Ordered a loco moco and after waiting 15 minutes the staff tells us they didn't make the rice and asked what we wanted instead. Hm ... a loco moco isn't really a loco moco without rice but ok. We asked for some whole wheat bread instead and they were about to give us just the bread but nothing else from the loco moco. Yeah for $12 that doesn't work at all. Finally got fed up and asked them what they could actually make, which turned out to be a burrito ($9.50 on the menu). Still no refund offered since we paid $12 for a loco moco. Had to tell them they owed us $2.50 and the guy at the counter stared at us blankly until we explained why we overpaid. The purple shark bowl was pretty good. But given that there were 5 people working here and only the one older gentlemen making the hot food knew anything about they had in stock is strange.",

            "For a beach community restaurant this is about as good as it gets.  We came here for dinner and was not disappointed.Casual yet better quality food than you may expect to find.There is a lot of interesting memorabilia an idea art to admire and it feels coastal.We had a cozy enough table and there is both indoor and outdoor seating.I started with a specialty cocktail, a Spicy Margarita, that was OK.  It was packed with alcohol, so for 12 bucks you're getting your money's worth.Then I tried 6 half shelled oysters. Again good, but not a knock your socks off. The flavor was just so-so that might be indicative of the type. The shells, however, were quite beautiful.I went on to have a menu special, the Portuguese Fisherman's Stew that was robust and quite delicious.  The flavors and mix of fish and shellfish were just right, although some broken mussel shell was in the stew. Fortunately it didn't lead to any dental issues! The stew flavor was the best part.The accompanying bread was excellent.Overall service was friendly and top notch. He was attentive and served professionally.We ended with a mud pie...oh my! Most filling and delicious but difficult to eat.  It was frozen so hard it took a sledge hammer to break it apart, but nonetheless worth it.Fun, interesting place and the BEST part was the music.  A duet on piano and cello that were most delightful and great background music for dinner. BRAVO!",
            "This place is not good. Like the other reviews mention, it's overpriced and the food is bad. I try to avoid low rating restaurants like Sand Dollar, however we had no reception to check out the available area restaurants and ended up here after a lady at the store next door recommended it. That was a bad recommendation!The service and interior is decent here, but it's the unpalatable food that brings it down. The \"grilled\" oysters are bland tasting and not grilled at all (more like lukewarm without any evidence of a grill). The fisherman's soup was quite bad. The sauce had no depth, the mussels tasted salty and old, and several of the clams were undercooked. Some of the worst seafood I've had in the Bay area. The only decent dish was the salmon, which tasted alright.Overall, I highly recommend against this place. However the options are limited in the area so plan ahead!",

We love watching the overlooking sunset; have brought relatives and visiting friends over for dinner and celebrate special occasions here many times.  As was the case with our most recent visit when we brought my in-laws after a stop to the local pumpkin patch with the kids to cap off my husband's last day of vacation.We ordered our usual appetizers: ceviche sampler, yuca balls and pulled pork bruschetta after giving our drink orders.  It is also kind of my last day of vacation myself before returning to our daily routines that involve two toddlers-so to relish it, I ordered a pina colada.  Even cracked a little joke to the waitress about pumping and dumping (breastfeeding reference for all you children-free folks).Anyway, fastforward to getting all our food including the main entres, all pretty happy, my drink arrived and it looks good.  Problem is prior to me realizing the drink is too strong, server already left.  Hailed her but she didn't see.  No problem, I kept myself busy with the food in front of me and I still had a coke and water with it.  I took a few more sips while waiting for her to see if I can enjoy it but no, still too strong!  Well it took her awhile to check back on our table that when she did I was 3/4s done with my plate already and when she asked \"how's everything?\" I along with everyone that replied the food was good, added with, \"My drink is a little too strong.\"  HER RESPONSE, \"YOU DON'T HAVE TO FINISH IT, ARE YOU OKAY?\"  and left.  My husband and I looked at each other and was like, Whaaat? Is she serious?  Yeah, we suddenly lost our appetite for dessert.It's service stuff like this that really irks me about establishments even when they have great food.  Also, makes me wonder if I looked white and blonde like her, would she even treat me that way?  Even if it isn't the case, it's not a good thought or feeling to leave your customers with.  It's a $15 dollar drink, I should be able to enjoy it instead of ordering another coke. Even then she was still being dense or just plain, could care less!  She also charged us a mandatory 20% gratuity even though our 6th person was a baby that was practically sleeping the whole time in his stroller and she didn't have to serve.  I'm sure she's enjoying her $53-dollar, self-imposed tip! As for us, we won't be coming back on a matter of principle.  At the end of the day, there's a lot of other restaurants to choose from.  I'm sure you can spend $350 dollars somewhere where you can get great food & service, and would actually remake your drink to your liking. Probably sans the obligatory gratuity which you would be happy to oblige as it would be well-deserved."

The mix of beer and frozen margarita isn't too boozy and good with a squeeze of lime.The carne asada burrito is delicious and filling after running around the beach and hiking the trails in Mt Tam. They have a couple salsas and pickled vegetables laid out to add to your food too. The carne asada fries is just what it sounds like - fries, marinated beef and cheese. Much simpler than what you'd find in San Diego but still really good hot out of the fryer. I'll be back on a warmer day for one of their shakes!",

            "A must eat if you are looking to try authentic Himalayan food! Monsoon is family owned by a friendly family from Nepal. I have been here twice now, but on our most recent visit this past weekend we ordered: vegetable momo, chicken momo, vegetable fried rice, paneer tikka masala, chicken palak, chicken tandoori, plain naan and some orders of brown and white rice.Everything was made to order and came out quickly and at the same time. Both the chicken and vegetable momos were delicious, especially with the homemade sauce! I typically enjoy vegetarian curries so paneer dishes are my usual go-to's. The paneer tikka masala was great! Liked that it was more seasoned and tasty than other places I've had it at. The naan was crispy and light. Paired great with all the dishes we got. Beer and wine options are plenty and most, if not all, are locally sourced from Bay Area breweries - Hermitage Brewing being one of the most abundant options on their menu. Clean restaurant. Well decorated, Plenty of seating. Friendly service!Will definitely be back again sometime soon. Monsoon is situated in a small strip mall right at the corner of 92 and 1 - super accessible for weary travelers. Stop by after a day exploring HMB or to take a break from driving Hwy 1. Monsoon's dishes will keep your belly warm after enjoying the (cold) beaches here. :)",
            "This is one of half moon bay's Asian subcontinent restaurants  which while having it's charms is not without some flaws.Parking is usually available in the surface lot associated with the strip mall this place is located in. While that can be massively busy -some of the nearby business are very popular as is the park associated with the lot-there will be a space available somewhere if not right in front. The decor and overall theme is quite charming. The seating is arranged in a sort of circular pattern around the center of the space which is set up as a kind of decorative shrine. It's not a real shrine mind you just a leftover from whatever was here before richly decorated. The seating is the standard table/chair combos but they are clean,new, and match the overall decor nicely. Overall the effect of the decor improves the overall feel. Service can be hit and miss. I've had excellent service once, indifferent service once and absolutely terrible service once, so it's hard to say what will happen next time. I've actually seen a waiter ask a couple to leave because they wanted to sit up front instead of by the restroom. Even though there were only two other people in the restaurant it seems he was unwilling to compromise on giving a four place table to two people. You know just in case hundreds of people showed up needing a four spot at five pm on a Monday. It's good to see a man who believes in standing on principle no matter what except of course it really isn't. Aside from that however the service was good on all our visits. The food is interesting. It's not really traditional Indian style cuisine. I suspect that it's not all that traditional Himalayan either, but to be fair I'm not a renowned Himalayan food scholar. I do note that on our last visit they didn't have momo. I mean they were on the menu but not available from the kitchen for some reason. So we had the thali instead which of course is not on the menu but was the daily special. A thali is a sort of sampling platter of six or so different things. It can be quite the taste experience as the intent is to offer a mixture of flavors textures and colors. Creamy, salty, sweet and spicy should all be represented in small stainless steel cups. Small portions but a lot of variety. Unfortunately this was something of a miss as it ran long on sweet or bland flavors. The time before that we chose paneer tikka and veg korma. Same story-the tikka was sweet the korma unremarkable. Pricing is standard for the area. Roughly twenty dollars a plate or slightly more depending on choices made.Overall it's not a bad choice especially if you are not a fan of the overspiced food which can be common at some East Indian styled places.  But it may not be richly textured and complex food either.",
            "Very Much enjoyed our lunch at Monsoon where China meets India with excellent Himalayan food. The food was  excellent with  good portions.Chill chicken for appetizers and Vegetable Samosa. The chilli chicken was enough for a meal. We also had the Tandoori chicken, vegetable biryani and the mixed vegetable curry . All the dishes are  awesome and you wont go hungry."

(Apparently, their corn they grind for the masa comes from Oaxaca #endNAFTA)I also ordered one of their cemitas.  The fried chicken cemita was crusp and delicious, and I had to go back to try their pastor cemita.  Fire Definitely worth the sto",
            "Great location right next to the ocean in Davenport.  This spot has tacos and cemitas with some really good pricing.  The restaurant is not very large but does have a patio with outdoor seating.  They had some live music playing but the overall quality of the artists was pretty sub par with two older gentlemen being the cast and crew.Enough with the bad news...the food itself is really tasty and well thought out.  The tacos are fresh and the ingredients are definitely the same.  They are cooked to order and you can tell they aren't sitting under some hot plate.  Definitely would recommend giving this place a shot!",
            "Very authentic Mexican food!!We tried queso fundido, street corn, guac and chips and salsa and chips as appetizers. They were all very good, specially the corn. Most of us had tacos al Pastor on corn tortillas. They were really yummy. They make their corn tortillas daily from Oaxacan corn. The al pastor Meet was very tasty. We also had Puebla Hot Chicken, Rajas and Beef Milanesa Cemitas (Sandwiches). Our teenagers liked them very much. The Rajas was a little hot for our wimpy kid...Great stop on our drive on Hwy 1!!"

            "Love the place, and really nice people but super busy. Great ham and cheese croissant, but ahem, the coffee - $5.00 for a medium late? $5:50 for a large. Fantastic views of the ocean but if I may recommend some barista training. The latte was like an americano with hot milk (no micro froth). Guys at that price it had better be better than what I can make on my Breville at home. I would suggest looking at your grinder (needs to be finer for espresso), increased arm pressure after grind on the cup before steaming, and make sure you have at least 11-14 BAR (should be min 14+ on a professional machine or it needs a service). Then you gotta have micro steamed milk or it's a cafe ole not latte. Did I work at Starbucks. No, YouTube! Also here's some suggestions photos (full disclaimer these photos are NOT Ebbtide Cafe but should be) and a high bar to reach (not pun intended). Will come back in a few months because the place is so cool but coffee didn't do it for me all sadly especially at that price or BYOC.Haha - someone complained about the latte examples that I posted and were removed by yelp. What a joke. Anyway it's all on YouTube on how to make a good latte but my latte photos were epic if you missed them.",
            "3.75 stars, rounded up. Location, location, location. No-frills coffee shop that delivers the basics, and little else, at a fair price. But the real estate--prime, quiet location that overlooks the majesty of the Pacific. I would definitely come back for the view alone. 2 stars for the coffee, 5+ stars for providing a quiet table overlooking an amazing view.  Street parking is hard to come by and tables are often occupied, but were you expecting anything else?"

            "I drove over to the coast to escape the horrible East Bay air during the Camp fire tragedy. I was going to make a quick stop at the outstanding San Benito deli in Half Moon Bay, which is a small but mighty portion of the whole San Benito establishment. The main restaurant had recently changed hands with a new Mexican theme, so decided to give it a try.Wow! Thanks to the Margaritas served up by the Cantina bar, our group ended making a bit of an afternoon of it (I had a classic lime and then the chipotle versions - both were excellent & potent. It was a sunny day so we were able to enjoy the well-landscaped & spacious patio (where they often have live music). The flavors of the dishes were more than solid. My faves were the exceptional BBQ wings from their hardwood smoker and the fried calamari taco; we also sampled the quesadilla, pozole, salmon taco, and nachos - all muy sabroso!Nice bar, two sports screen, fireplace in the patio, big outdoor event space behind the patio. The friendly owner, Chris gave us a tour of the historic guest rooms upstairs he's slowly remodeling. All around, a find. Of course I couldn't leave without getting my deli sandwich to go.",
            "Unexpected find in downtown Half Moon view. The restaurant is a seat your self place with cantina food. Came her with a friend and we found the food to be really good and reasonably priced. The service was a little slow, but there wasn't tons of staff, plus it is a bar. The salsa and guacamole was really good! Quesadilla - nice and crispy, good cheese balance. Vegetarian street tacos were good, not a ton going on but they were good (comes with corn, cheese, black beans and cabbage). Chicken street tacos were good (chicken, onion and cilantro). The strawberry margarita was awesome, nice tamarind rim.",
            "Holy cow, ya'all! Or chicken, in this case! Delicious, buttermilk marinated fried chicken breast sandwich that had a new flavor in every bite! And nachos drenched in white chicken chili, housemade guacamole and roasted corn. Yum! Te Elote Con Queso. Corn lollipops slathered in creamy aioli, cotija cheese and chili powder, was a great starter too. The strawberry margarita was tasty and strong and the Elysia Star Dust made the whole meal complete. In the heart of Half Moon Bay, this cantina is a throwback to another era and you could feel the community from the bar full of familiars to the fast and efficient bartenders to the locals and tourists mingling. Couldn't recommend this place more!"

            "I came to the Village Pub at the end of January with my supervisor after visiting the Apple Park and was pleasantly surprised, although for two people it easily came up to $500 with half a bottle of wine, two main courses, one appetizer, and one dessert.I really enjoyed the bone-in ribeye there, which was tender and flavorful. It was rich in texture but not overpowering. Oh, and don't forget to add on the foie gras supplement! The Baked Alaska dessert we had looked very nice, but was slightly disappointing as I thought it was overly burnt and had too much of a woody smell to the ice cream.  What I most enjoyed was the old-American style classiness in its decor. The interior had a uniform reddish hue theme, with red bricks, high wooden plank ceilings, dimmed lighting, and traditional white table cloth. Most people were older and well-dressed. The whole scene struck me as quite elegant. Village Pub is located in Woodside, which is about 20 mins away from Palo Alto. I really liked how the restaurant is located by itself in a semi-secluded area. The moment you walk out of the restaurant, you are met with some very fresh air, and a sky full of stars. I don't think there is a lot in the area, but it seems like there are some residential community nearby and some small shops. If I had the chance, I might try a little walk around the area and then come for a great night cap.",

I was happy with my drink.Parking is little hard but get there early to secure a spot. Parking is free though. The chef gave us some complimentary cookies to take home. Definitely, we're going back."

The calamari steak is something I have ordered multiple times. The fish and chips/cole slaw combo is great. Those stand out the most. And the service is really pleasant and friendly also.If you like piano music, they have someone providing music in the evenings. The parking is right next to the place. Just be careful and don't run over any of the tourists taking pictures with their back to the traffic as they stand in the middle of the road taking sunset pics. Sunset heart pic? Lots of them take those. By the way, the patio is dog friendly to man's best friend.A bit on the pricey side though, but then everything on the Coastside is.  So 3.5 stars about right."

I definitely preferred the 2 Meat Combo; it was cooked just right and I appreciated having the bbq sauce on the side so that it wouldn't be a soggy mess and so that I'd have the option of having it with or without sauce (rather than having it drowned in sauce with every bite).To get more into specifics, the ribs were fall off the bone delicious and the brisket was definitely something else (in a good way of course)! This place is a must try for bbq!",

Overall wasn't impressed with the food, but it wasn't bad either. Will probably come here again to try their brisket before casting another irrelevant yelp review.Service was awesome though. The staff is very friendly and welcoming!",
            "The kids and I worked up an appetite exploring Mori Point for a few hours before we stopped by Gorilla Barbeque.  The portions here are HUGE!  The 3-meat combo literally was a half pound per meat option, the pork ribs were the size of beef ribs, and the half chicken was pretty big too.  We were hungry, but probably wouldn't even finish all the food if another family was with us.I really enjoyed the BBQ sauce here.  It's not overly sweet like traditional bbq sauce.  It had the perfect tangy and sweet balanced taste and went well with all the meat cuts.I didn't care for the side as much, but the flavorful meat and delicious bbq sauce were definitely the stars.The line seemed long, but it moved very quickly and efficiently.  The staff was incredibly welcoming and friendly.  There wasn't much seating, so we just sat in the back of the Rav 4 and dug in."

The view is of an airfield outside, if you don't mind the cold you can eat outside with the elements attacking you (slight wind chill during winter time). The bonus is if any of these small biplanes land you can see it first hand outside. From the inside you can see the planes once they land but not as much as if you were outsideThe food was good, with a toddler and 8yr old they were very pleased with their food.Here is what we sampled and how it all fairedThe chicken fried steak, size wise was decent, no it did not taste like freshly battered steak but it did have its perks, the meat was semi hard, still enough to cut it apart without a knife but an edge of a spoon, the hash browns and the over easy eggs were made just right. The meat again was not rubbery it was more of slightly tender thin sliced meat that was super deep fried, with that white gravy all over the top. I would come back and order this again. The wife ordered an omelette with black beans, pico de gallo, latin rice on the side, I want to say the omelette had sliced onions, bell peppers and chorizo, again the meat I did not recall but the whole dish of what I sampled was delicious, see pictures below hahaThe kids they ordered the pancakes, my son the 2 stack pancakes, my daughter the child mickey mouse pancakes, all made with buttermilk, fluffy, dense, and delicious my 3yr old kept sayingThe interior was a little odd, as if it was something else before, definitely not a restaurant. the whole interior on the walls were filled with pictures of the past, the ceilings had several model planes hanging, take your idevices away from the kids and have them look around explore the walls and the model planes hangingDefinitely a place I would visit againfood **** better then decent servings hereprice $$service ***** daughter spilled milk all over the floor, quickly cleaned up, no one batted an eye, I guess it happens here sometimes hahaambiance **** the pictures, model planes, pretty much everything about this place is a gem. try to get a seat by the airfield."

            "Still soft opening so not many people, need no wait for Sunday dinner. AYCE has reasonable price and non-discounted service. Ingredients were fresh. Soups were incredible flavorful. Honestly I didn't expect that great soup base because I heard of this store as 'sister store of tasty pot' and tasty pot was famous for extremely bland soup bases. I also like their sauce bar. The only con may be limited selection of dishes which might be because it was just soft opening. This mall has a slightly deserted feeling to me. If appropriate, FENG SHUI could be improved in the interior for better vibes.Will come back.",
            "3.5 stars. Called at 7:18pm today to add my name to the wait list. Was told that there were three parties ahead of us with an approximate wait time of 20 minutes. We arrived 30 minutes later and the wait list had not moved at all. We ended up waiting another 30 minutes before we were seated.Service was pretty slow at the beginning and food was coming out at a snail's pace. We ended up getting some meats before our soup came out. They were also out of quite a few items. I get that it is their soft opening weekend so I am cutting them some slack. The manager did come by a couple times to apologize for the long wait and them running out of certain items which I appreciate. Overall, I thought that the soup bases were tasty (we tried the house special spicy and the seafood broth) and the meats were really fresh but I would like to see a bigger selection of items. I also wish their skewers were part of the AYCE price (they currently charge $0.50 per skewer). I would come back again but only if there was no wait.",
            "Nice new addition to the Daly City hot pot scene. It's the sister restaurant to Tasty Pot, but in my opinion, the more refined one. Supreme Pot has a tablet ordering menu that allows you to make you're own hot pot soup selection. You're allowed two styles per hot pot, which is a pretty cool feature.There are about six hot pot soup broths, but warning to vegetarians, only two are water based so ask before order. The options for soup toppings were plentiful with a wide array of vegetables, seafood, and meat. During this experience we ordered tofu, taro, achoy, bokchoy, potatoe, daiko, broccoli, and a few more yummy seafood options which my husband enjoyed. In addition to the wide array of options we were ordered, we were given a seafood platter with crab legs, shrimp, mussel, fish, and squid.  This was an opening day special which made my husband's eyes light up as he's a huge seafood fan. While we waited for the soup and toppings, we headed over the sauce bar and the sides bar. The sauce bar had a ton of mix ins as well as garlic, ginger, etc. The sides bar had fresh fruit, sesame balls, edamame, etc. Overall it was a great experience. The servers were friendly, the spicy broth was true to its name (definitely had a kick to it), and the mix-ins/toppings were super fresh. Definitely a great start for this new Daly City locale."
